<h2>welcome to fran hat's game reviews</h2>

<p>did i love it? it'll be here. did i hate it? it'll be here</p>

<p>spoilers?? i promise nothing but i'll try to be good</p>

<h3>Nintendo Switch</h3>

<h4><b>Catherine Full Body</b></h4>

<p>Forewarning: I played Catherine on the PS3 and only got Katherine true end. I didn't do K's true end (or good) this time, but I did the rest.</p>

<p>this game has like 5 new endings, jp voices, and idk like 10 more voice options for catherine!! have you ever wanted to hear iori-chan play catherine?? its awesome. also a remix mode where you get tetris pieces instead of only single blocks. i played the remix for my playthrough and it was fun. i cant remember how to play normal though.</p>

<p>catherine and katherine both get an alternate endings. catherine's is awesome, katherines is boring.</p>

<p>RIN. perfect design. cute personality! what could go wrong!?! a lot. playing rin's route made me want to put down the game and never pick it up. i somehow managed to power through just barely. it was awful. I did not have any problem with rin until doing her route.</p>

<p>Overall, I would recommend this game over the PS3 version. Just don't do Rin's route. the JP voice track was all i needed to be convinced tbh.</p>

<h3>Nintendo 3DS</h3>

<h4><b>Yo-kai Watch 3</b></h4>

<p>f*ck this game. absolute garabge. i could not finish it.</p>

<p>listening to hailey anne is miserable. i do not know if it's better in japanese. i want to stab myself everytime i hear her talk.</p>

<p>i did not enjoy the "busters" parts of yw2. I did not ever enjoy "oni time". somehow they became big parts of this game and it is just miserable for me.</p>

<p>the localizers wrote themselves into a localization hole when they set the first 2 games in america. nate has to move from USA to BBQ. the currency is BBQ bucks. everyone has a southern accent and he needs a youkai's help to understand them. honestly im impressed they managed to come up with an explanation at all.</p>

<h3>Playstation 4</h3>

<h4><b>Nier Replicant</b></h4>

<p>NOTE: i have not finished ending E yet. I'm waiting for my "nier claw hand" to go back to normal. I have finished A-D.</p>

<p>this game was super fun for the first 30 hours! the fight system feels a lot like nier automata (good thing!)</p>

<p>the next 20 hours were excruciating. "artificial length" describes this game well. you have to repeat the 2nd half of the game THREE (3) times minimum with only slightly more information each time. many boss fights are dragged out because you can only hurt the boss so much until the characters finish their lines. you just do no damage until the script is over</p>

<p>i'd rather read the novelization or wiki. the explanations weren't very deep and i still have a lot of questions.</p>

<p>the characters are all absolutely beautiful. i keep looking at the twins and thinking "dang i want a doll with a faceup like that". everyone is gorgeous!! its great. </p>

<p>if you're going to play this, i'd suggest playing it before nier automata. automata does spoil a fair bit of this one and references it as well</p>

<h4><b>Nier: Automata</b></h4>

<p>this dumbb*tt deleted her save and STILL played it again to get a 100% achivement playthrough</p>

<p>its so fun! the story is fun! the gameplay is fun! the characters are beautiful! i pretty much love everything about this game!</p>

<p>hacking turns your hands into claws. it is painful. im sorry. a lot of this game turns your right hand into a crab claw</p>

<p>i want to kiss 9S</p>
