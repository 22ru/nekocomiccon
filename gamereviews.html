<h2>welcome to fran hat's game reviews</h2>

<p>did i love it? it'll be here. did i hate it? it'll be here</p>

<p>spoilers?? i promise nothing but i'll try to be good</p>

<h3>Nintendo Switch</h3>

<h4><b>Catherine Full Body</b></h4>

<p>Forewarning: I played Catherine on the PS3 and only got Katherine true end.</p>

<p>this game has like 5 new endings, jp voices, and idk like 10 more voice options for catherine!! have you ever wanted to hear iori-chan play catherine?? its awesome. also a remix mode where you get tetris pieces instead of only single blocks. i played the remix for my playthrough and it was fun. i cant remember how to play normal though.</p>

<p>catherine and katherine both get an alternate endings. catherine's is awesome, katherines is boring.</p>

<p>RIN. perfect design. cute personality! what could go wrong!?! a lot. playing rin's route made me want to put down the game and never pick it up. i somehow managed to power through just barely. it was awful. I did not have any problem with rin until doing her route.</p>

<p>Overall, I would recommend this game over the PS3 version. Just don't do Rin's route. the JP voice track was all i needed to be convinced tbh.</p>

<h3>Nintendo 3DS</h3>

<h4><b>Yo-kai Watch 3</b></h4>

<p>f*ck this game. absolute garabge. i could not finish it.</p>

<p>listening to hailey anne is miserable. i do not know if it's better in japanese. i want to stab myself everytime i hear her talk.</p>

<p>i did not enjoy the "busters" parts of yw2. I did not ever enjoy "oni time". somehow they became big parts of this game and it is just miserable for me.</p>

<p>the localizers wrote themselves into a localization hole when they set the first 2 games in america. nate has to move from USA to BBQ. the currency is BBQ bucks. everyone has a southern accent and he needs a youkai's help to understand them. honestly im impressed they managed to come up with an explanation at all.</p>
