<h2>welcome to fran hat's game reviews</h2>

<p>did i love it? it'll be here. did i hate it? it'll be here. i dont want to review games i didnt finish unless i hate them so much i refuse to finish them.</p>
<p>spoilers?? i promise nothing but i'll try to be good</p>

<p>i try not to recommend games i havent finished so i'll note any game i havent completed (if it is completable).</p>

<h3>Nintendo Switch</h3>
	<h4>Animal Crossing New Horizons</h4>
	<p>yes i paid $60 for half a game. no i may not be buying the next one despite playing since gamecube.</p>
	<p>i used to love isabelle and now i've tossed all my isabelle merch into a box to forget about her telling about her video chat with her parents or her falling asleep watching tv or ...</p>
	<p>half assed game with no items, looks well polished but has no content. the DLC with actual content never came out btw. they did add some things they left out from new leaf. might as well play new leaf though. your villagers will have a lot more interesting things to say</p>
	<p>remember the track that played 24/7 for the first few days of the game? f*ck you Nintendo.</p>
	<p>Nov 2021 edit: the dlc and update is finally out and i feel like this game may have been enough content to release as a full game. i still dont know where gracie is and i would like to upgrade my nook shop still</p>

	<h4>Captain Toad Treasure Tracker</h4>
	<p>captain toad is so cute that i cried when i first saw him. if you love things that are cute and little puzzles, you will like this game.</p>

	<h4>Catherine Full Body</h4>
	<p>Forewarning: I played Catherine on the PS3 and only got Katherine true end. I didn't do K's true end (or good) this time, but I did the rest. I technically should have seen all the endings though.</p>
	<p>this game has like 5 new endings, jp voices, and idk like 10 more voice options for catherine!! have you ever wanted to hear iori-chan play catherine?? its awesome. also a remix mode where you get tetris pieces instead of only single blocks. i played the remix for my playthrough and it was fun. i cant remember how to play normal now though.</p>
	<p>catherine and katherine both get an alternate endings. catherine's is awesome, katherines is boring.</p>
	<p>RIN. perfect design. cute personality! what could go wrong!?! a lot. playing rin's route made me want to put down the game and never pick it up. i somehow managed to power through just barely. it was awful. I did not have any problem with rin until doing her route.</p>
	<p>Overall, I would recommend this game over the PS3 version. Just don't do Rin's route. the JP voice track was all i needed to be convinced tbh.</p>

	<h4>Disney Tsum Tsum Festival</h4>
	<p>i bought this for $10 on clearance and its definitely worth that or less! if you ever wanted to play tsum tsum without the microtransactions or an arcade machine, maybe you should buy this. the other party minigames are stupid at best, but i spent a couple hours playing tsum tsum. the original game is handheld only in portrait mode btw. i highly recommend not spending much money on this game.</p>

	<h4>Hatsune Miku Logic Paint S</h4>
	<p>about as good as a picross game gets! my big complaint is that the BGM songs are only about 2 minutes long and continuously loop until you exit to the menu and go to settings and change the song. i dont want to listen to the same song 10 times while i do a 20 minute puzzle. a random song option would improve this game so much. there are no touch screen controls if you are looking for those.</p>
	<p>i had some issue with the controls or assist change in the first update and I don't have hope for them fixing it.</p>

	<h4>Katamari Damacy Reroll</h4>
	<p>honestly pretty fun but it's not very long! only like 5 hours. controls are hard to get used to.</p>

	<h4>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h4>
	<p>if you are looking for a great zelda game, this is not your game. this is nothing like a zelda game, but is still very fun. i love wandering around and discovering new things in it and there are so many places to wander! my favorite genre of game is "walking game" probably. the soundtrack is a joke.</p>
	<p>i have yet to find all of the cute little koroks. i love koroks!!!</p>

	<h4>The Legend of Zelda: Linkie no Wakeup</h4>
	<p>I havent played ALL of the zelda games, but this one is my favorite!!! I laughed I cried i got stuck for 3 hours on that damn raccoon. its a very faithful remake with some new additions, but i wish they kept the photo booth! it sure is nice to have extra buttons instead of having to switch your items every 30 seconds</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrYJ5z-be8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">face shrine</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04kJYqdWyy8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animal village</a> are my favorite tracks</p>

	<h4>Nelke and the Legendary Alchemists</h4>
	<p>(unfinished) i didnt expect it when i bought it but, this is like sim city with anime girls. the story seems pathetic and the scenario is retarded. it feels like the entire game is cameos for characters in games ive never played. I havent finished the game but i dont expect the story to improve.</p>
	<p>there's a bug in the playtime tracker so your time will include the time spent in sleep mode. this soon will be my top played game of all time.</p>
	<p>if you want to play sim city with anime girls, this game is probably for you!! dont expect much else. I'm still interested in it enough to play it despite not being super into it.</p>

	<img src="img/game/nelke.jpg" />

	<h4>Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</h4>
	<p>cute story. didn't end up with a super happy ending as i expected. it's an overworld style rpg that feels like it inspired a lot of youkai watch's gameplay. marcassin is basically howl without the flamboyant personality. your party members will drain their MP at any given chance (if you let them) and it is infuriating.</p>
	<p>port issues: my game crashed multiple times and even once during saving. my save file was not lost otherwise i would have called it quits half way through</p>

	<img src="img/game/ninokuni.jpg" />

	<h4>Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 01</h4>
	<p>i only bought this because it was $9 and i wanted to build the piano. i built the piano and now it's just taking up space. also the stickers on the piano aren't staying on.</p>

	<h4>Ōkami HD</h4>

	<p>This game has beautiful style and fun gameplay. I had no idea how goofy this game was going to be, but it was very goofy! I was very shocked to see how much boobs and butts were shown. What's this rated?! You gain the ability to pee on enemies as a taunt, but why is a female wolf lifting her leg?!</p>

	<p>My issue is that the story wasn't anything captivating and it felt like it just kept going. I did hit some major slowdown (like 14fps) during a couple battles. I did not have any difficulty in battle until the Kusa 5 which are not even necessary to fight. I had a little trouble with a dungeon puzzle, died a couple times, then suddenly the puzzle was dumbed down to baby easy without asking. I would have liked to try it a few more times. I did have to look up answers to a few of the puzzles. If you're looking for a challenge, this isn't your game.</p>

	<p>I played the entire thing handheld. I can't imagine not using the touch screen on this game. I was really annoyed that the R button started the drawing, but I'm right handed so it made it awkward!! At the very end of the game, I found you can switch it in controller settings. Don't be like me and wait until the end.</p>

	<p>It was cute, it made me laugh, and I probably won't play it again.</p>

	<img src="img/game/ookami.jpg" />

	<h4>Pokemon Shield</h4>
	<p>this is a bad pokemon game. all the new pokemon are super cute though! i was able to form a team of all new pokemon since there were so many good new ones. theres a pokemon or two with a incredibly arbitrary evolution trigger that there's almost no way to get without looking it up or maybe on accident.</p>
	<p>i hope you didnt want to battle more than 5 trainers on each straight shot route. the wild area is large but i think there should be multiple. its not big enough.</p>
	<p>it was creepy to watch cutscenes with mouth animations and no voices. hop is a loser. swordbert and shieldbert are just so impressively stupid. i couldnt believe they werent jokes.</p>

	<h4>Pokemon Shining Pearl</h4>
	<p>this is the best pokemon game in years and gamefreak didnt even develop it. i honestly love it.</p>
	<p>biggest complaint is that the art style has chibi characters but hands. why fingers?? make mitten hands.</p>
	<p>i encountered no game breaking glitches, only small annoyances. in the underground, when digging up a box, the line "the box started to shine!" appears twice in a row. there is lag between stepping in grass and the encounter animation starting.</p>
	<p>the underground is addicting. i spent like 50 hours down there digging. i just want to dig up statues all day!!!!</p>

	<img src="img/game/pkmnshiningpearl.jpg" />

	<h4>Splatoon 2</h4>
	<p>this game is so much fun. the atmosphere is awesome, the gameplay is awesome, the story mode is a joke, the players are actually 10 years old. its a good time!</p>
	<p>i highly recommend octo expansion, but i do feel it should have been originally included rather than paid dlc</p>

	<img src="img/game/splatoon2.jpg" />

	<h4>Story of Seasons Friends of Mineral Town</h4>
	<p>i bought this so i could marry popuri and i married her and now she leaves our child unattended while she visits her mom all day. she is a terrible mother.</p>

	<img src="img/game/sosfomt.jpg" />

	<p>kind of a hack/cheat i recommend: if there is an event by the ocean, time will stop and you can fish there until your pockets are full. i made too much money this way. tbh fishing is the easiest and fastest way to make money</p>

	<h4>Xenoblade Definitive Edition</h4>
	<p>thank god all their faces got fixed. the old style was wonderful but their faces just werent. i didnt love the story as much as X2, but still had a great time with this one.</p>
	<p>some areas in this game are just stunning. satorl marsh at night is beautiful. walking through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8oowKzNIlU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valak Mountain</a> at night was so memorable to me.</p>
	<p>they did add retconning to this edition. it's rather small though but youll likely notice it if you played X2. future connected wasnt anything special. the two nopon were cute though!</p>
	<img src="img/game/xenoblade.jpg" />

	<h4>Xenoblade 2</h4>
	<p>I love this game!!! ive played it a few times now. the first run through is super confusing because the bad guys kinda look alike. they all have different personalities and goals, but i couldnt figure it out the first time. this game is full of little and big love stories. Jin is the best bad guy, Zeke and Saika are the best pairing.</p>
	<p>hikari is the stupidest annoyign girl ever. she drove me nuts until i played Torna. there's a lot more to her than you see in xenoblade 2 alone. i now pick her every time i get to the end of the game</p>
	<p>after playing xenoblade, i realize there's a lot of retconning. I'm super disappointed about that. i kind of wish they were completely unrelated. They do have slightly intertwined stories but im not sure if its too important which one you play first.</p>
	<p>sometimes my party members would fall off cliffs and die in the middle of battles. that part was not fun.</p>

	<img src="img/game/xenoblade2.jpg" />

	<h4>Xenoblade 2: Torna - The Golden Country</h4>
	<p>i highly recommend you play this one and then play Xenoblade 2 again. it explains a lot of Hikari and Jin's backstories you're just in the dark about through that game. it should have probably been included with it tbh since it's so important to it</p>
	<p>it has my favorite gameplay of the 3 Xenoblade titles i've played. they're all variations of the same battle system anyway.</p>

	<img src="img/game/xenoblade2torna.jpg" />

	<P>IM SHIPPING IT</P>

	<h4>Yoshi's Crafted World</h4>
	<p>your basic yoshi title. incredibly cute! all the courses are designed to be played in 2 directions so youll play the same course until you're tired of it. easy mode is so easy that it is a joke. normal mode is not particularly difficult either.</p>

<h3>Nintendo 3DS</h3>
	<h4>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</h4>
	<p>I had so much fun with this one. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbjbGNa-7eE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11 pm</a> is my favorite track</p>

	<h4>Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer</h4>
	<p>This game was fun for a few hours. it didn't feel like there was any benefits from the effort you put in so it wasnt a rewarding game</p>

	<h4>Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash</h4>
	<p>absolute garbage do not buy this game. i spent $7 and still feel ripped off. unfinished (obviously)</p>

	<h4>Detective Pikachu</h4>
	<p>you can skip this one unless you like mystery games where the questions are like "what color do you get when you mix yellow and red?"</p>
	<p>the JP voice actor for the detective was great! he's the only reason I finished the game. i cannot recommend this game at all</p>

	<h4>The Legend of Zelda: A Linkie Between Worlds</h4>
	<p>this was pretty short but fun and cute. story was dumb but i like how much it felt like a link between worlds and also collecting cute little maiamai</p>

	<h4>Pokemon Y</h4>
	<p>basic pokemon game with a cool lumiose city and rollerblades. didn't stand out to me too much.</p>

	<h4>Pokemon Omega Ruby</h4>
	<p>the most memorable part of this game was flying over the region. i bought it on my birthday and the woman at target said happy birthday to me when she checked my ID. i went to crab pot and ordered a clam chowder bowl and played it while the waiter side eyed me the entire time. thanks for reading my review.</p>

	<h4>Pokemon Moon</h4>
	<p>I actually really enjoyed moon! i love lillie and nebby! completely removing the grid and adding cutscenes was a bold move, but i liked it. the playable character has the worst facial animations in the history of time tho. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HaPrKnn2T8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poni wilds</a> was a good track (and luckily a good place to grind)</p>

	<h4>Pokemon Ultra Moon</h4>
	<p>it's just a slighly modified moon tbh. you really dont need both. might as well just get this one instead.</p>

	<h4>Yo-kai Watch</h4>
	<p>so fun!! the combat is super fun!! definitely a dumb little kid's story but this game was so fun anyway</p>

	<h4>Yo-kai Watch 2 Psychic Specters</h4>
	<p>if youkai watch was so good why isnt there a youkai watch 2??? this game is even more fun than the first but they are incredibly similar.</p>

	<h4>Yo-kai Watch 3</h4>
	<p>f*ck this game. absolute garabge. i could not finish it.</p>
	<p>listening to hailey anne is miserable. i do not know if it's better in japanese. i want to stab myself everytime i hear her talk.</p>
	<p>i did not enjoy the "busters" parts of yw2. I did not ever enjoy "oni time". somehow they became big parts of this game and it is just miserable for me.</p>
	<p>the localizers wrote themselves into a localization hole when they set the first 2 games in america. nate has to move from USA to BBQ. the currency is BBQ bucks. everyone has a southern accent and he needs a youkai's help to understand them. honestly im impressed they managed to come up with an explanation at all.</p>

<h3>Playstation 4</h3>
	<p>i hate playing games on the TV so there's not much here</p>

	<h4>Nier Replicant</h4>
	<p>NOTE: i have not finished ending E yet. I'm waiting for my "nier claw hand" to go back to normal. I have finished A-D. UPDATE: I probably wont finish this game and i hate it.</p>
	<p>this game was super fun for the first 30 hours! the fight system feels a lot like nier automata (good thing!)</p>
	<p>i spent way too much time grinding in the junk heap for items for quests and ended up overleveled for the rest of the game.</p>
	<p>the next 20 hours were excruciating. "artificial length" describes this game well. you have to repeat the 2nd half of the game THREE (3) times minimum with only slightly more information each time. many boss fights are dragged out because you can only hurt the boss so much until the characters finish their lines. you just do no damage until the script is over</p>
	<p>i'd rather read the novelization or wiki. the explanations weren't very deep and i still have a lot of questions.</p>
	<p>the characters are all absolutely beautiful. i keep looking at the twins and thinking "dang i want a doll with a faceup like that". everyone is gorgeous!! its great. </p>
	<p>if you're going to play this, i'd suggest playing it before nier automata. automata does spoil a fair bit of this one and references it as well</p>
	<p>my favorite song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viDKam_hmGM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaine ~ Salvation.</a></p>

	<h4>Nier: Automata</h4>
	<p>this dumbb*tt deleted her save and STILL played it again to get a 100% achivement playthrough</p>
	<p>its so fun! the story is fun! the gameplay is fun! the characters are beautiful! i pretty much love everything about this game!</p>
	<p>hacking turns your hands into claws. it is painful. im sorry. a lot of this game turns your right hand into a crab claw</p>
	<p>i want to kiss 9S</p>
	<p>my favorite track is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXlPt8mFkNI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">song of the ancients - atonement</a>. it's actually also kaine ~ Salvation, but techinically thats purely a nier ost song. i actually like just about every track except weight of the world. it is acceptable in JP and 8-bit, but english is terrible.</p>

	<h4>Persona 5</h4>
	<p>the weakest of the latest 3 persona games imo. it was good but it wasnt awesome! my life did not change but it was a fun time</p>
	<p>it was cool to see the negotiations come back but not being able to grind out an entire dungeon in 1 day was crummy. my SP disappeared way too fast so i never wanted to use it.</p>
	<p>i love morgana, ryuji, and ann!</p>
	<p>the music was good even if jazz isnt my thing. the entire style of this game was awesome. the story just didnt hit home for me or something. I didn't love this game enough to want to play Royal</p>

	<h4><a href="img/13sentinels.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</a></h4>
	<p>i looked forward to this one for many years! its mostly visual novel and a chunk of RTS gameplay. the visual novel was fun but didn't seem fully thought out. There was a few little holes here and there and the twist was unexpected but kind of a cheap one. probably my 2nd favorite vanillaware title despite this. (possibly because none of the other stories have held up either)</p>
	<p>they really outdid themselves with the 2d rendering. the way the light shines through the windows in the old building is so beautiful. i would love an art book for this game</p>
	<p>i loved exploring the relationships between the characters. i LOVE tomi. she is perfect! pretty much all the characters are in a relationship with another.</p>
	<p>i got some major slowdown when there was around 1k enemies on the screen but i suppose that's to be expected. i even played on a ps4 pro. the RTS parts are not super detailed or anything. more basic shapes representing objects.</p>
	<p>the two vocal tracks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKdIhT3Feks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seaside vacation</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCeWAA2T0Ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brat overflow</a> are awesome and i wish there were more.</p>

	<p>Fujoshi alert!!! There is a canon gay couple!</p>

<h3>Playstation Portable/Vita</h3>

	<h4>Shin Megami Tensei Persona</h4>
	<p>i wasnt strong enough to finish this. it was too hard and i hate grinding. watch out for hanako. great vocal songs!</p>

	<h4>Persona 3 Portable</h4>
	<p>i played the girls version. oh boy this was good. great music. good story. good ending!</p>
	<p>aigis and ryoji are my favorites! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHdOXCoja-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kimi no kioku</a> is a banger of the century.</p>
	<p>watch out for spoilers when walking through pink gorilla. cover your ears. dont be like me.</p>

	<h4>Persona 3 Dancing Moon Night</h4>
	<p>total cash grab. remixes are mostly lame</p>

	<h4>Persona 4 Golden</h4>
	<p>this game is great!! highly recommended! good and fun twists. pretty much every song on the ost is awesome.</p>
	<p>my life was changed by the beautiful bear teddie. he is SO CUTE</p>

	<h4>Persona 4 Dancing All Night</h4>
	<p>this was fun! not a must buy but i think most of the remixes were decent at minimum. the dedemouse remix is garbage though just dont play that one.</p>
	<p>side note for the launch edition with a vita skin: there is adhesive on the screen part of the skin, but not the sides. it makes NO SENSE at all. i used double sided tape to get it down, but this "bonus" is garbage and i will never trust an atlus 'special' edition againg.</p>

	<h4>Steins;Gate</h4>
	<p>i had to watch my beloved favorite girl die exactly 13 times.</p>
	<p>there was a glitch in the vita version where it said i didnt get all the art despite finishing the whole game. I had to go back and do mayushii's end again after searching and searching for what i missed.</p>
	<p>better than the anime because it goes deeper ofc. i did not like suzuha's ending and i'll never be able to forget it.</p>

	<h4>Muramasa Rebirth</h4>
	<p>my expectations were too high but it was worth what i paid ($14). very beautiful game as usual from vanillaware. story wasn't anything special.</p>

	<h4>Odin Sphere Leifthrasir</h4>
	<p>i love the art i love the story and i love how it all plays out. theres at least 3 love stories in there and you know im a sucker for those. gameplay was fun for each of the characters but mercedes was hardest to get used to! my favorite vanillaware title! possibly my favorite game.</p>
	<p>Side note for the launch edition with artbook: the artbook content is great, but the book itself feels very cheap and cut rate. this was the paperback one and i have not held the hardcover edition one.</p>

	<h4>Dragon's Crown</h4>
	<p>maybe this would have been fun multiplayer. too much sh*t was going on on the screen and i couldnt figure out where my character was. there's not much of a story but i don't know if i just didnt get far enough to find it. i don't intend to finish this game. beautiful art though.</p>
