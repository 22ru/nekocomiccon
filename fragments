    <p>Ryan and I went to a consignment shop we visit a few times a year. I found some cute pokecards and Ryan also found a few! Mine are on the right and his are on the bottom.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Goo Goo Dolls - Dizzy Up the Girl $1</li>
        <li>Nickleback - All the Right Reasons $1</li>
        <p>I think this was one of the ones I passed on for $3.</p>
        <li>Kare Kano 1 $1</li>
        <li>Kodocha 1-3, 5-7 $1 each</li>
        <p>I went back to the booth at the consignment shop I previously bought Kodocha 4 at and they had so many more this time!! My dumb b*tt didn't bother to update my manga page with which volume I already had but google saved my butt in finding the blog post on the fly.</p>
    </ul>
