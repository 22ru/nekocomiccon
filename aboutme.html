	<p>this website has been online for <span id="secSinceCreation">a couple</span> seconds! why did i make this site?? because i saw <a href="https://neppermint.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ryan</a> making his and i steal all his good ideas!</p>

	<p>i, in all my great wisdom, wrote the site to be entirely reliant on JS (i wouldn't recommend copying that choice, it was a bad one) and i would apologize for it, but the facts are, if you have javascript disabled, you won't be able to navigate to this page to see my apology!! i plan to write a builder for my site that makes it functional without JS but today is not that day.</p>

	<h2>computer informations</h2>
	<p>I am using (but not very good at) Debian and sometimes Windows 7! I used Win7 up until the end of life and then almost completely switched over until I need to use anything in CS6. I'm not a fan of Win8. I used to use mIRC on Windows, but I use irssi now.</p>

	<p>I use a IBM Model M. I have no interest in collecting or modern mechanical keyboards but if you want to come clean my keycaps we can work something out.</p>

	<p>I started writing this site in Pluma, but Ryan convinced me to try visual studio code. okay okay i admit it is better than pluma.</p>

	<p>my sewing machine is a Husqvarna Viking 6460. It half works sometimes. I bought it for $20 at a yard sale and it has served me very well for what i paid. is anyone even coming here for sewing machine info??</p>
