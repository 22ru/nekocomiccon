I miss 2015 twitter! Maybe you do too. Feel free to recreate the experience of sending out your funniest joke to the world with this RSS feed viewer and Twitter simulator.

Be sure to place 
onload="retrieveXML()"
in your body tag!

XML/RSS file tag requirements:
channel
    title
    link
    description
    author

    image
        url
        title
        link
    
    item
        title
        pubDate
        link
        description


These all fit the minimum RSS requirements so this should be RSS reader readable.

The author tag is your name. Feel free to add your @ and verified checkmark.

The image tag is your profile picture. I'm using a direct link instead of a relative link but I have no idea if it makes a difference to RSS readers.

Your first post goes at the bottom and should be 0 if you choose to link it. The latest post is at the top with the highest post number. It's not my problem if you delete a post and it breaks everything.

The item title is your post. Keep it under 140 characters!

The (misused) item description tag is your included image. This is optional. Leave the tag empty if you do not want to include an image with your post.
