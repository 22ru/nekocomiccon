<h2>Game Boy Camera</h2>

<p>I bought this at Al's in Seattle for $8 back in March 2016. It was extra cheap because green is ugly (sorry). Ryan let me use his SP at Sakuracon that year so I took all those photos upside down. I did not have one as a kid but I use it with my childhood GBC (and Ryan's GBC with a backlight) now.</p>

<p>I get my photos developed by leaving the cart on Ryan's desk with a flash drive. Ryan has a printer too but it has this horrible issue where reciept printing lasts like 2 years max.</p>

<p>hover for more info! i'm usually not this kind but some of these are really hard to tell what they are</p>
