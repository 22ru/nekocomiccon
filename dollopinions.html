<h1>
my hot takes (on dolls)
</h1>

<p>if you're looking for a reason to hate me, you're in the right place</p>

<h2>luxury items</h2>
	<p>no one wants to hear this, but you dont need one. don't put it on your credit card. there's no such thing as a doll emergency. (by don't put it on your credit card, i mean don't spend money you dont have. feel free to get air miles.)</p>
	<p>to people with 20+ limited edition dolls: are you okay.</p>

<h2>quit buyin from danny</h2>
	<p>he is literally begging you to stop buying from him! please stop! he doesnt want your business!</p>

<h2>grail dolls</h2>
	<p>is it really a grail if you can just straight up buy it with enough money?</p>

<h2>scalpers</h2>
	<p>the best way to combat scalpers is to not buy their items. let them rot with the $1000 investment they made that they dont want to keep.</p>

<h2>research</h2>
	<p>"my legit doll is lower quality than a recast!" did you do your research? I could have told you that it would be</p>
	<p>please for the love of god, find every owner picture of the doll you can and save it to your hard drive before deciding to send this international company $600</p>

<h2>recasts</h2>
	<p>recasters are awful but dont let them ruin your fun. you dont need to sit and worry about proving your doll is legit unless you're selling it.</p>
	<p>if recasters arent charging extra for expensive sculpts that are already above msrp in the secondhand legit market, they should.</p>
	<p>unlike most doll companies, recasters are not running small businesses. go check their sales figures. 6000 dolls sold in 6 months is insane</p>
	<p>i cant understand why people are willing to spend such a large sum of money for a bootleg. recasts are cheaper, but not cheap.</p>
	<p>has anyone actually managed to change a recast owner's (or hopeful owner) mind? reading the pro-artist arguments every day is annoying. let's just enjoy dolls</p>

<h2>volks</h2>
	<p>no matter how stupid a welcoming ceremony sounds, you still make me want to do it</p>
	<p>why is mother SD a premade virgin mary statue when you have amazing sculptors that could make a much better one</p>
	<h3>dollfie icon</h3>
		<p>what the h*ck were you thinking, volks? why? how could you charge so much for a doll with mismatched joints?</p>

<h2>chinese doll companies</h2>
	<p>only ringdoll and angell studio are worth looking at. go look up what the ringdoll sculptor looks like btw. i do not admit to being biased after meeting him. (i am)</p>
	<p>mirodoll is a joke. those dolls aren't worth their shipping cost.</p>

<h2>den of angels</h2>
	<p>you deleted all my box openings and now i am sad</p>
	<p>everyone's box openings are gone and I am VERY sad</p>
	<p>ban dollzone and doll chateau dolls. companies have been banned for less while dollzone started as a honest to god recaster!</p>
	<p>danny's dolls are off topic please delete the multitude of posts about them</p>

<h2>doll owners</h2>
	<p>the world doesn't want to hear about your DnD character</p>

<h2>bluefairy</h2>
	<p>your heads are literally perfect. your faceups are literally perfect. your bodies were literally perfect. why did you put a JOINT at the top of the upper arm?!?! why are there so many ugly joints!?!</p>
	<p>please sell the classic bodies again. i can't buy a neo body.</p>
