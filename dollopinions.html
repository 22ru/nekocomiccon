<h1>
my hot takes (on dolls)
</h1>

<p>if you're looking for a reason to hate me, you're in the right place. i have many opinions after being in this hobby for over 10 years</p>

<h2>my personal ideal doll traits</h2>
<ul>
	<li>SD sized</li>
	<p>theres something so impressive about large dolls. my favorite size by far.</p>
	<li>flat chested</li>
	<p>young girls or mature girls doesnt matter! the less titty the better. i also cant figure out how to sew darts</p>
	<li>open mouth smile</li>
	<p>MY HEART</p>
	<li>female</li>
	<p>i mean i wouldnt say no to a boy doll...</p>
	<li>white or normal skin</li>
	<p>let's face it, I only bought tan dolls because they were limited. I used to not like WS but in 10 years the doll will be almost NS anyway</p>
	<li>human ears</li>
	<p>my elf ear days are over. goodbye.</p>
</ul>

<h2>luxury items</h2>
	<p>no one wants to hear this, but you dont need one. don't put it on your credit card. there's no such thing as a doll emergency. (by don't put it on your credit card, i mean don't spend money you dont have. feel free to get air miles.)</p>
	<p>to people with 20+ limited edition dolls: are you okay.</p>

<h2>consumerism</h2>
	<p>DONT THINK JUST BUY BUY BUY</p>
	<p>stop buying dolls just because the company and community is tricking you into only getting adrenaline rushes from opening a new box</p>
	<p>if you truly want this limited doll, you will find it later.</p>
	<p>rereleases are not impossible (unless you're in love with a DOD)</p>
	<p>try creating something once in a while! sew your doll a shirt! knit a scarf! its fun i promise</p>

<h2>quit buyin from danny</h2>
	<p>he is literally begging you to stop buying from him! please stop! he doesnt want your business!</p>
	<p>my life would be better if i could erase this man and his dolls from my mind</p>

<h2>grail dolls</h2>
	<p>is it really a grail if you can just straight up buy it with enough money?</p>
	<p>if your grail is easily obtainable and under $300 you need to lurk more</p>

<h2>research</h2>
	<p>"my legit doll is lower quality than a recast!" did you do your research? I could have told you that it would be</p>
	<p>please for the love of god, find every owner picture of the doll you can and save it to your hard drive before deciding to send this international company $600</p>
	<p>is this company going to take a year or more to send your doll to you? you'd better find out!!</p>

<h2>recasts</h2>
	<p>recasters are awful but dont let them ruin your fun. you dont need to sit and worry about proving your doll is legit unless you're selling it.</p>
	<p>if recasters arent charging extra for expensive sculpts that are already above msrp in the secondhand legit market, they should.</p>
	<p>unlike most doll companies, recasters are not running small businesses. go check their sales figures. 6000 dolls sold in 6 months is insane</p>
	<p>i cant understand why people are willing to spend such a large sum of money for a bootleg. recasts are cheaper, but not cheap.</p>
	<p>has anyone actually managed to change a recast owner's (or hopeful owner) mind? reading the pro-artist arguments every day is annoying. let's just enjoy dolls</p>

<h2>volks</h2>
	<p>no matter how stupid a welcoming ceremony sounds, you still make me want to do it</p>
	<p>why is mother SD a premade virgin mary statue when you have amazing sculptors that could make a much better one</p>
	<p>please note that all (expensive) volks furniture is made out of pleather and has a limited lifespan before you buy</p>
	<h3>dollfie icon</h3>
		<p>what the h*ck were you thinking, volks? why? how could you charge so much for a doll with mismatched joints?</p>

<h2>chinese doll companies</h2>
	<p>only ringdoll and angell studio are worth looking at. go look up what the ringdoll sculptor looks like btw. i do not admit to being biased after meeting him. (i am). i dont actually like ringdoll's faces very much sorry.</p>
	<p>mirodoll is a joke. those dolls aren't worth their shipping cost.</p>

<h2>den of angels</h2>
	<p>you deleted all my box openings and now i am sad</p>
	<p>everyone's box openings are gone and I am VERY sad</p>
	<p>ban dollzone and doll chateau dolls. companies have been banned for less while dollzone started as a honest to god recaster!</p>
	<p>danny's dolls are off topic please delete the multitude of posts about them</p>
	<p>to the makers of doll profiles: "provenance" means origin or history not proof of legitimacy. stop putting "coa" for provenance!!!</p>

<h2>OCs</h2>
	<p>the world doesn't want to hear about your DnD character</p>

<h2>bluefairy</h2>
	<p>your heads are literally perfect. your faceups are literally perfect. your bodies were literally perfect. why did you put a JOINT at the top of the upper arm?!?! why are there so many ugly joints!?!</p>
	<p>please sell the classic bodies again. i can't buy a neo body.</p>

<h2>Culur</h2>
	<p>recently, many new doll collectors coming over from instagram have listed "culur theory ery" as their grail doll. i imagine this has to do with a disinterest in research.</p>
	<p>culur and her dolls are all banned on DoA. You cannot mention or show a photo of a culur theory doll there. you might think "oh those awful mods are just ban happy!" but culur did bring this all upon herself.</p>
	<p>i was a doll expo which had specifically asked that no one bring a recast in and i saw a stunning white skin minifee girl there with her young owner. i later found out it was culur and her recast.</p>
	<p>culur was banned from DoA for posting a photo her recast doll there. she claimed she didnt think anyone would notice.</p>
	<p>around the time of culur's ban, DoA was invite only for quite a while. new users had to be invited by a current user to make an account and the current user would be responsible for the user invited. culur was found to be asking multiple users to invite her back to doa.</p>
	<p>there was once a big fuss when culur tried to sell her recast doll without mentioning that it was a recast. she said she didnt think it was important information and that no one would assume it is legit.</p>
	<p>i dont think anyone deserves their doll being recasted, but i am not feeling sympathetic this time. i hope on both sides of the recast argument, people will refuse to support her for her dishonesty and repeated "mistakes".</p>

<h2>doll elitism</h2>
	<p>oh! haha you caught me!</p>

<h2>yellowing</h2>
	<p>if it's not uneven, it's not as bad as everyone makes it sound</p>
	<p>that being said, its probably not a good idea to buy a doll with blue resin unless you want a green doll in 5 years</p>

<h2>secondhand market</h2>
	<p>the best way to combat scalpers is to not buy their items. let them rot with the $1000 investment they made that they dont want to keep.</p>
	<p>i will never enter a transaction with a person who charges me their paypal fees or asks to send the money friends and family. i dont care how bad i want it. stay away from these sellers. if you are one of these sellers, include the fees in your original price.</p>
	<p>i cannot recommend trades because you are unlikely to get a doll you truly want and love out of one. if you really just love getting a new doll and opening the box, this may be great for you!</p>

<h2>doll meetups</h2>
	<p>i want to go to there</p>
	<p>please invite me</p>
	<p>meetups are a wonderful way to enjoy more doll sculpts without buying them!</p>
	<p>i miss my friends</p>

<h2>wigs, clothes, etc</h2>
	<p>my favorite wig brands are leekeworld/dollga, luts, and mandarake's himezakura line. i do not like volks wigs.</p>
	<p>i cannot find nice shoes not made out of pleather and all my old shoes are peeling and disgusting.</p>

<h2>BJDivas</h2>
	<p><a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/can-i-ask-for-a-refund-2-year-wait-lost-order.846108/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a DoA user was upset about how she's been waiting 2.5 years for a dollzone doll etc etc</a> and some users offered her some advice. BJDivas read the posts and posted on their private facebook, they posted the history of the user's orders and said they contacted the mods to have the posts removed. a user found an older post by them from december 2020 where they threatened to pursue legal action against anyone who "slanders" the company to explain why they're so hard to talk to.</p>
	
	<p>if they forget to tell you your doll never arrived, its not their fault and dont post your opinion about their service if you dont want to get sued!</p>
