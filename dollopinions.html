<h1>
my hot takes (on dolls)
</h1>

<p>if you're looking for a reason to hate me, you're in the right place. i have many opinions after being in this hobby for over 10 years</p>

<h2 id="favtraits">my personal ideal doll traits</h2>
	<p>if you want me to buy your doll just follow this guide to get to my heart</p>
	<ul>
		<li>SD sized</li>
		<p>theres something so impressive about large dolls. my favorite size by far.</p>

		<li>flat chested</li>
		<p>young girls or mature girls doesnt matter! the less titty the better. i also cant figure out how to sew darts but thats on me</p>

		<li>open mouth smile</li>
		<p>MY HEART. i love little simplistic white teeth, but not detailed ones. I really don't like when teeth are painted with a line between them</p>

		<li>female</li>
		<p>i mean i wouldnt say no to a boy doll...</p>

		<li>white or normal skin</li>
		<p>let's face it, I only bought tan dolls because they were limited. I used to not like WS but in 10 years the doll will be almost NS anyway</p>

		<li>human ears</li>
		<p>my elf ear days are over. no fantasy parts please. goodbye.</p>

		<li>very specific knees</li>
		<p>when the resin from the thigh piece extends over the kneecap rather than the resin from the calf piece. i.e. every unoa and all DDs past DD1.</p>

		<li>single jointed</li>
		<p>no fancy knees, no fancy elbows, and just one joint around the waist area is perfect.</p>
	</ul>

<h2>doll traits i HATE</h2>
	<p>just because i dont like them doesnt mean you shouldnt (i guess). these are all dealbreakers for me</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ugly knees</li>
		<p>knee bean joints drive me insane and most double jointed knees are done in this way. if the knee bean can turn around in the socket, i will be even more upset. fairyland's knee mechanism doesn't bother me for some reason.</p>

		<li>double-ball hip joints</li>
		<p>i.e. atelier momoni. also hip joints where the ball is attached to the torso i.e. dust of dolls. ALSO mobility joints.</p>

		<li>rigid sculpting</li>

		<li>excessively long arms</li>
		<p>i.e. angel fantasy. slenderman.</p>

		<li>very flat hands and long wrists</li>

		<li>noodle limbs</li>
		<p>i do want my dolls to be thin, but i dont want them to be shapeless!! danny has this problem big time.</p>

		<li>upper arm slits</li>
		<p>i.e. bluefairy's neo bodies. this makes your design look like a playline doll faster than any other choice.</p>

		<li>domuya flexi bodies</li>
		<p>im glad this went out of style because i hate everything about them. the cut outs in the joints absolutely disgust me</p>

		<li>B&G Sapphira</li>
		<p>i cant put into words why i hate this doll so much. it wouldnt make sense even if i could explain it</p>
	</ul>

<h2 id="buying">luxury items</h2>
	<p>no one wants to hear this, but you dont need one. don't put it on your credit card. there's no such thing as a doll emergency. by don't put it on your credit card, i mean don't spend money you dont have. feel free to get air miles from your doll purchase.</p>
	<p>if you have to put the doll on layaway for over a month you really dont need the doll. please be financially responsible.</p>
	<p>to people with 20+ limited edition dolls: are you okay.</p>
	<p>you can save up enough to buy one. i believe in you!</p>

<h2>consumerism</h2>
	<p>DONT THINK JUST BUY BUY BUY</p>
	<p>stop buying dolls just because the company and community is tricking you into only getting adrenaline rushes from opening a new box</p>
	<p>if you truly want this limited doll, you will find it later.</p>
	<p>rereleases are not impossible (unless you're in love with a DOD)</p>
	<p>try creating something once in a while! sew your doll a shirt! knit a scarf! its fun i promise</p>

<h2>wait times</h2>
	<p>unfortunately, most doll companies run off the preorder model, where you pay in full and wait while your doll is produced.</p>
	<p>this is a terrible business model but most of us are willing to put up with it since these are small businesses and theres not really any other choice rather than buying used</p>
	<p>do not let an untrusted company in another country to hold your money outside of paypals protection period. you probably shouldn't be ordering from companies with wait times over 6 months.</p>
	<p>back in 2010, customhouse had a 1 year wait time which was considered outrageous at the time. somehow a 1 year wait is slowly becoming the norm</p>

<h2>secondhand market</h2>
	<p>the best way to combat scalpers is to not buy their items. let them rot with the $1000 investment they made that they dont want to keep.</p>
	<p>i will never enter a transaction with a person who charges me their paypal fees or asks to send the money friends and family. i dont care how bad i want it. stay away from these sellers. if you are one of these sellers, include the fees in your original price.</p>
	<p>i cannot recommend trades because you are unlikely to get a doll you truly want and love out of one. if you really just love getting a new doll and opening the box, this may be great for you!</p>

<h2>put your money where your mouth is</h2>
	<p>i wish i could say this to my boss when he tells me im awesome.</p>
	<p>do you like some weird feature on a doll that only one artist makes? buy the doll and stop posting about how you wish there were more dolls with fat rolls.</p>
	<p>dont like scalpers? neither does anyone else. dont buy from them.</p>
	<p>this company had an unacceptable wait time? dont buy from them.</p>
	<p>support what you like, dont support what you hate.</p>
	<p>in the end, you are not the target audience for any doll company outside of your own country</p>
	<p>if you want the doll and dont want to support the creator, you could but second hand, but keep in mind that the person you bought it from is likely just to give that money back to the creator and support them more</p>

<h2>grail dolls</h2>
	<p>is it really a grail if you can just straight up buy it with enough money?</p>
	<p>if your grail is easily obtainable and under $300 you need to lurk more</p>

<h2>research</h2>
	<p>"my legit doll is lower quality than a recast!" did you do your research? I could have told you that it would be. some companies have awful QC and you need to figure out who those are before sending them hundreds of dollars</p>
	<p>please for the love of god, find every owner picture of the doll you can and save it to your hard drive before deciding to send this international company $600</p>
	<p>is this company going to take a year or more to send your doll to you? you'd better find out!!</p>
	<p>if a company's current wait time is 1+ years, i cannot suggest more that you buy secondhand or not at all</p>

<h2>choosing a doll</h2>
	<p>choosing a doll to fit your budget usually ends in selling the doll at a loss</p>
	<p>you may not find the perfect doll until youve viewed hundreds of dolls</p>
	<p>starter dolls are cheap for a reason. keep in mind, you would still be spending a significant amount of money that could be put toward something you'd love much more</p>

<h2>boxes and CoAs</h2>
	<p>nothing feels less personal than a CoA that doesnt even bother to have the sculpt name written on it. thanks for the barcode?</p>
	<p>if i get a doll with my name handwritten on the CoA i dont think it could be more special</p>
	<p>i love boxes with white pillows! I'm not really interested in foam cut outs too much and im 100% not interested in plastic bubble pillows. how cheap.</p>
	<p>the ultimate "box" is a carrier. Iplehouse used to send their YIDs in them and maskcatdoll sends a hard case. these are awesome!!</p>
	<p>i cant really understand why people throw their boxes away unless they have a significant number of dolls. you do you though...</p>

<h2 id="companies">volks</h2>
	<p>no matter how stupid a welcoming ceremony sounds, you still make me want to do it</p>
	<p>why is Mother SD a premade virgin mary statue when you have amazing sculptors that could make a much better one</p>
	<p>please note that all (expensive) volks furniture is made out of pleather and therefore has a limited lifespan before you buy</p>
	<p>i want to go to a dollpa so bad someone please take me!!!</p>
	<p>free idea for volks: make some resin eyes out of your ever beauty formula</p>

	<h3>dollfie icon</h3>
		<p>what the h*ck were you thinking, volks? why? how could you charge so much for a doll with mismatched joints?</p>

	<h3>SD16</h3>
		<p>why did you ask a fashion doll company for advice on the american market when the american market loves you for what you have already?</p>
		<p>someone please tell me if that ribcage joint has any use whatsoever</p>

<h2>Alchemic Labo</h2>
	<p>Gentaro Araki is my favorite sculptor of all time!!!</p>
	<p>the engineering choices in unoa 1.0 were way ahead of their time and I cant wait to see what this man comes up with next</p>

<h2>quit buyin from danny</h2>
	<p>he is literally begging you to stop buying from him! please stop! he doesnt want your business!</p>
	<p>my life would be better if i could erase this man and his dolls from my mind</p>
	<p>why is he marketing to actual children this is just weird.</p>

<h2>chinese doll companies</h2>
	<p>almost all of the big chinese doll companies make dolls not worth looking at. they look like they paid a sculptor a few bucks to pop out a head and another a few more bucks to pop out a body. not many were started by an artist who hoped to sell their work to the world. there are exceptions, but i find this to generally be the case. anything considered a "starter" doll is not worth buying. you will most likely find that the worthwhile chinese dolls cost the same as korean and japanese dolls.</p>
	<p>my exceptions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>angell-studio</li>
		<p>the sculpt quality of these dolls is right up there with other more expensive dolls, but the price does match these other companies. this company charges paypal fees though so i would never buy from them directly.</p>
		<li>granado</li>
		<p>not my taste at all but this company makes some very handsome realistic men! I've heard they have great service as well</p>
		<li>gulliver xiaoxiao</li>
		<p>incredibly small dolls!!</p>
		<li>Flower&Junior</li>
		<li>and more! i dont watch chinese companies very closely tbh</li>

	</ul>
	<p>there are so many small chinese artists who deserve your attention as well. these dolls are definitely not mass produced with the sole intention of making money. these dolls will not cost you $200 for an MSD, so don't go in with that expectation.</p>
	<p>myoudoll can manage to sculpt a cute face and cover it with a nice faceup but their bodies are as basic as the other cheap companies...</p>
	<p>mirodoll is a joke. those dolls aren't worth their shipping cost.</p>

<h2>korean doll companies</h2>
	<p>talk about diversity, we got a company that churns out just about every style you can think of here.</p>
	<p>most korean dolls are better sculpted than the average chinese budget doll</p>
	<p>company chicabi needs more research. awfully cute...</p>
	<p>here is your warning: dollshe is running a ponzi scheme. DO NOT BUY.</p>
	<p>Haru Casting requires you to prove your anti-recast stance by putting "pro-artist" on your instagram profile and sending him the link to order a doll. wat.</p>
	<h3>bluefairy</h3>
		<p>your heads are literally perfect. your faceups are literally perfect. your bodies were literally perfect. why did you put a JOINT at the top of the upper arm?!?! why are there so many ugly joints!?!</p>
		<p>please sell the classic bodies again. i can't buy a neo body.</p>

<h2>american doll artists</h2>
	<p>get off instagram jesus christ</p>
	<p>theres a whole world waiting for you just outside your door!</p>
	<p>there must be something more inspiring out there than influencers</p>

	<h3>Culur</h3>
		<p>recently, many new doll collectors coming over from instagram have listed "culur theory ery" as their grail doll. i imagine this has to do with a disinterest in research.</p>
		<p>culur and her dolls are all banned on DoA. You cannot mention or show a photo of a culur theory doll there. you might think "oh those awful mods are just ban happy!" but culur did bring this all upon herself.</p>
		<p>culur was banned from DoA for posting a photo her recast doll there. she claimed she didnt think anyone would notice.</p>
		<p>around the time of culur's ban, DoA was invite only for quite a while. new users had to be invited by a current user to make an account and the current user would be responsible for the user invited. culur was found to be asking multiple users to invite her back to doa.</p>
		<p>there was once a big fuss when culur tried to sell her recast doll without mentioning that it was a recast. she said she didnt think it was important information and that no one would assume it is legit.</p>
		<p>i dont think anyone deserves their doll being recasted, but i am not feeling sympathetic this time. i hope on both sides of the recast argument, people will refuse to support her for her dishonesty and repeated "mistakes".</p>

<h2>Dealers</h2>
	<h3>BJDivas</h3>
		<p><a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/can-i-ask-for-a-refund-2-year-wait-lost-order.846108/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a DoA user was upset about how she's been waiting 2.5 years for a dollzone doll etc etc</a> and some users offered her some advice. BJDivas read the posts and posted on their private facebook, they posted the history of the user's orders and said they contacted the mods to have the posts removed. they transfered this user's order back to dollzone directly because of this "abuse"</p>
		<p>facebook post by them from december 2020 threatens to pursue legal action against anyone who "slanders" the company. they seem to consider negative feedback abuse.</p>
		<p>airs their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BJDivas/posts/1256111538185287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="i cant actually tell if this link works because i dont have a facebook account">dirty laundry</a> about bad customers on their public facebook page. didn't bother to censor real names or emails. not even danny has gone this far.</p>
		<p>if they forget to tell you your doll never arrived, its not their fault and dont post your opinion about their service if you dont want to get sued!</p>
		<p>if i had an account with them, id probably be banned for writing this</p>
	
	<h3>Denver Doll Emporium</h3>
		<p>sold me a new doll that had been displayed so long that the front of it was yellowed. didn't respond to my email when i contacted them about it (this was a year later in their defense).</p>
	
	<h3>Dolk</h3>
	<p><a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/dolk-company-reviews.390368/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not order from dolk ahahahaha wtf!!!!</a></p>

<h2>wigs, clothes, etc</h2>
	<p>my favorite wig brands are leekeworld/dollga, luts, and mandarake's himezakura line. i do not like volks wigs. i'm a big fan of heat resistant fiber.</p>
	<p>acrylic eyes are like the lowest of the low. they dont offer great clarity and the irises are often just printed. resin eyes are like the fast fashion of eyes. they can be beautiful and well made but in the end, resin yellows and will need to be replaced. glass eyes can be mediocre to awesome. I think they're probably the best option when you find good ones</p>
	<p>i cannot find nice shoes not made out of pleather and all my old shoes are peeling and disgusting.</p>
	
<h2 id="recasts">recasts</h2>
	<p>no one enjoys reading this kind of stuff. please feel free to skip it. it's all been said before and theres nothing humorous to make it worth reading.</p>
	<p>recasters are awful but dont let them ruin your fun. just because everyone is virtue signaling the legitimacy of their dolls doesnt mean you need to. you dont need to sit and worry about proving your doll is legit unless you're selling it. every one of my box opening photos were taken for fun, not for proof.</p>
	<p>i cant understand why people are willing to spend such a large sum of money for a bootleg. recasts are cheaper, but not cheap.</p>
	<p>recasters (namely oueneifs) are not running small businesses. this was once a small business out of someones house, but go check their sales figures. 6000 dolls sold in 6 months is insane. Taihe Zhongshe Toy Co., Ltd. (oueneifs) has a good sized factory with lots of staff and even a show room. this business is possibly larger than volks at this point and i have to wonder if more recasts exist than legit.</p>
	<p>if you look at the photos of this factory, their workers are sanding resin without proper respiratory protection if that makes any difference to you to know they are actually poisoning their workers.</p>
	<p>i know i can't convince anyone, but please please consider the consequences for the hobby (and their staff) before supporting counterfeiters. if you already own recasts, its not too late to stop buying them. if you absolutely must buy a recast, please buy one secondhand to avoid supporting criminals.</p>
	<p>has anyone actually managed to change a recast owner's (or hopeful owner) mind? reading the pro-artist arguments every day is annoying so my hot takes wont leak out of this section too much. let's always just enjoy dolls</p>

<h2 id="communities">den of angels</h2>
	<p>you deleted all my box openings and now i am sad</p>
	<p>everyone's box openings are gone and I am VERY sad</p>
	<p>ban dollzone and doll chateau dolls. companies have been banned for less while dollzone started as a honest to god recaster!</p>
	<p>danny's dolls are off topic please delete the multitude of posts about them</p>
	<p>to the makers of doll profiles: "provenance" means origin or history not proof of legitimacy. stop putting "coa and box" for provenance!!!</p>
	<p>the mod are doing their best. don't be too hard on them. moderation has become a lot less strict in recent years as well.</p>
	<p>if your account is less than 3 years old and you are posting d*mb *ss sh*t, consider your opinion discarded</p>

<h2>social media and discord</h2>
	<p>we have lost so much information by posting in unorganized places that lose posts quickly to time. these places are not set up to be archived.</p>
	<p>sales and trades on these places can be incredibly sketchy! do not pay friends and family and do not send out a trade with no collateral. does this person have feedback? find out everything you can, but these places do not have accountability like forums and ebay. their account could be mysteriously deleted and you could be out of luck</p>
	<p>reddit is not a good source of information. neither is amino or discord.</p>

<h2>OCs</h2>
	<p>the world doesn't want to hear about your DnD character</p>

<h2>doll meetups</h2>
	<p>i want to go to there</p>
	<p>please invite me</p>
	<p>meetups are a wonderful way to enjoy more doll sculpts without buying them!</p>
	<p>i miss my friends</p>

<h2>doll elitism</h2>
	<p>oh! haha you caught me!</p>
	<p>those awful elitsts group who only accept volks dolls dont exist btw. as far as i know, they were only rumors. not everyone at the meetup will like your doll, but youre welcome to bring it! exception: please dont bring a recast to meetups where recasts are not allowed. if someone unknowlingly posts a picture of your recast on an anti-recast forum, they will be in big trouble. its also disrespectful.</p>

<h2 id="etc">yellowing</h2>
	<p>if it's not uneven, it's not as bad as everyone makes it sound</p>
	<p>that being said, its probably not a good idea to buy a doll with blue resin unless you want a green doll in 5 years</p>

<h2>how to pronounce doll names</h2>
	<p>no one should give a he*k if you pronounce minifee "mini-fee" or "mini fay". it honestly does not matter as long as i can figure out what youre talking about. its okay to tease but i dont think anyone seriously cares.</p>
	<p>volks is not pronounced like "volks" in german but i doubt you made that mistake if you speak english natively</p>
	<p>i heard a korean pronounce iplehouse like ipplehouse once so ive been saying that wrong for years</p>
	<p>i know unoa is pronounced you-know-a but its just not going to happen.</p>

<h2>bonding</h2>
	<p>its kind of a weird thing to think about and people think too much into it. to me, its only a strong emotional attachment to an object.</p>
	<p>i am at the point where i would not fully replace a doll i have "bonded" with that had been lost or destroyed because it would not be the same chunk of resin. a piece like a thigh or a hand doesn't apply to this.</p>
	<p>some people just bond with their OCs but I'm not part of that world so no comment</p>
