<h2>patterns (for your doll or you if you are very small)</h2>

<p>i hope to add my sd10 dressform pattern, but I need to find a scanner first.</p>

<h3>SD yukata (under construction!!!)</h3>

<p>shown on IH oYID (model) boy and SD10 girl. if you have issues with my kitsuke, go back to your immortal geisha discord group and let everyone know.</p>

<p>this pattern is based off the measurements of a yukata i already own. It should be scalable to any size doll, but I'll have to write a bit of simple algebra down later for you to use. I used a height of 54cm and a wingspan (wrist to wrist) of 38cm. i used 1 cm for seam allowance, and rolled every seam under and secured it with a blind hem stitch. it is completely unlined. mine is made out of cotton, so its technically a yukata, but you could make yours out of silk.</p>

<p>there are a few differences between mens and womens kimono. for one, men don't wear furisode (long sleeves) or have ohashori (fold under the waist). it's illegal to put your boy in a furisode but i won't call the cops on you. the fit on the male oYID body isnt perfect, it should be slightly longer to hit his ankles and the sleeves should hit his wrists.</p>

<p>another issue not yet remedied is the collar is not stiff enough. I may add a tomoeri to thicken it up. you WILL have to handsew at least the eri on to keep the fabric from bunching around the neck.</p>

<p>here's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimono#/media/File:Kimono_parts.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kimono diagram</a> since i am a weeaboo.</p>

<h4>Step 1: cutting the pieces</h4>
<p>For the furisode sleeves, cut two 12x72cm. For the body, cut one 21x111cm. For the okumi (front panel), cut two 8x46cm. For the eri (collar), cut 68x4cm. For the tomoeri, check back later.</p>

<h4>Step 2: the body piece</h4>
<p>i found the middle of the strip and cut upward 55cm (height+1cm). i measured around 8 cm in from each shoulder part and cut from the middle outward until i reached that point. i'll make a diagram for this part (and the rest of the parts).</p>

<p>from here, i folded the back in half and made a seam 1 cm in. the body should technically be 2 strips, but this saves the effort of adding a french seam.</p>

<p>next i connected the okumi (front panel) using a french seam.</p>

<h4>step 3: adding the eri (collar)</h4>

<p>press the collar strip in half and sew the ends together leaving 1cm at each end. pin the center of the collar to the center back (right side to right side). place a pin on the front panel</p>
