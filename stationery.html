    <h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>

    <h3>Ballpoint pens</h3>
    <p>Uniball Jetstream is my favorite ballpoint pen. It feels smooth just like a gel pen!</p>

    <p>Other than Jetstream, I don't really enjoy using these. I have ended up with a decent collection of Parker and Cross pens though.</p>

    <h3>Gel pens</h3>
    <p>Trying a .38mm Signo was life changing! I've come to really like the Signo line because of it.</p>

    <h4>Signo RT1</h4>
    <p>I've been swapping refills into my favorite bodies. I have a Little Twin Stars Signo RT1 that I will be putting all my refills in as they run out. I tried just about every refill in my pen and here are my findings. I've found a lot of different brands fit in it, but not Energel. Surprisingly, UMR-83 does fit in Energel bodies!</p>
    <p>Compatible: Uni-ball UMR-83, UMR-85, UMR-87, SXR-7 (Jetstream) Zebra JF Sarasa, Papermate InkJoy</p>
    <p>Incompatible: Uni-ball UMR-1, LP2RF (Juice), SXR-89 (Jetstream), Pentel Energel LRN7, LR7</p>

    <h4>Papermate Inkjoy</h4>
    <p>I do really like the ink in these. They're very smooth and fun! .5mm doesn't appear in the wild very often though.</p>

    <h3>American pens and pencils</h3>
    <p>.7mm is not "fine". It frustrates me that it's rare to find .5mm and nearly impossible to go lower than that!</p>

    <h4>Fountain pens</h4>
    <p>I have a super cute kakuno filled with violet scented ink. The nib has a little girl face which is TOO CUTE. absolutely adorable. the pen smells so good. I just love nearly everything about it. I have had trouble with it being finicky which was solved with a cleaning.</p>

    <p>My second (impulse buy) fountain pen is a pink pilot petit1. I had no idea these existed until I held one in my hands. The nib appears to be the F version of the disposable Pilot Varsity, which shouldn't excite you. It's scratchy and the tines didn't seem to be aligned after I pulled it out of its little wrapper. It's a $4 pen after all.</p>

    <p>The petit1 convinced me that if I want to buy another fountain pen, to buy up, not down. It is a cute little pen but not nearly as enjoyable.</p>

    <h3>Highlighters</h3>
    <p>I hate highlighters. I cannot find a use for them other than filling my trash can. If you need to highlight it, you didn't need to write the rest of page. Take better notes.</p>

    <h3>Every Day Carry School Edition</h3>

    <p>In high school, I used PaperMate Clearpoint .7 mechanical pencils and switched to Bic Reaction .7 before I graduated. I was able to convince my mom to buy me a graphing calculator for geometry, which was a TI-84 Plus Silver Edition.</p>

    <p>In college, I continued to use my Bic Reaction for a couple years, then bought a set of Pentel Twist-Erase GT .7. In my 2nd to last year, I lost my pencil after my Signals and System exam. I'm 90% sure I cried over it! I was so distraught that I went home and ordered a Rilakkuma Uni kuru toga to replace it with money I had made doing a Kaguya Luna commission for a friend. Before my kuru toga arrived, my chronic lab partner told me he had found my pencil after the exam and gave it back to me. Bless.</p>

    <p>By the end of high school, I realized how much I hate spiral bound notebooks. The rings just get bent and then they become the largest pain to use! While I was in Seattle, I bought the cutest notebooks I could find at Daiso for notetaking. For homework and anything I had to do on paper, I used a box of dot matrix paper. After returning to the middle of nowhere, I used the cheapest composition notebooks I could find for notes. I had to leave my box of dot matrix paper behind in the move, so I started using paper out of recycling bins and my old lab print outs for homework and scratch paper. I also carried a small metal ruler which I found on a desk and never really used. Could have been handy I guess...</p>

    <p>I continued to use my TI-84 for most of college, but my friend and lab partner was particularly partial to the TI-86 and gave me one, which was named "J. Boogard" after the name inscribed on the back. I bought another one at a Goodwill because I liked it so much. It is particularly good at vectors so complex numbers are a breeze! I found a TI-92 in a Goodwill during my last semester and holy cow this calculator is a beast!! I brought it to my Digital Communications Systems final but wasn't fast enough with it, so I switched back to my TI-86. This bad boy can do integrals which is awesome because they constantly slip my mind.</p>

    <p>I didn't use pens often in school. I'm sure I carried one with me, but not one of any value. Pens are no good for engineering or math and you cannot change my mind. I always carry an extra eraser though! Sometimes it's just the cute silly ones from Daiso.</p>
