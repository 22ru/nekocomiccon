<h4>Rena Lange Jeans jumperskirt</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03955.jpg" />
<p>my new favorite jumperskirt! $4.29 at my favorite thrift store. all the labels are ripped off.</p>

<h4>????? jumperskirt</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03957.jpg" />
<p>my former favorite jumperskirt. $15 or so at University District Goodwill in Seattle. the labels all contradict each other. i wish i knew who made this. its absolutely falling apart. i've had to fix the straps more than once and the lining is ripping</p>

<h4>AATP Winding Rose Corset JSK</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03948.jpg" />
<p>i bought this on mandarake for $80 a while back. has the matching headpiece. i cant find any excuse to wear it and it's a bit too big on me. it's 2007 so its bordering on oldschool (right?!??!)</p>

<h4>Royal Hawaiian Creations plumeria dress</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03950.jpg" />
<p>size s. im not big into muumuus but this has such a pretty cut and print. can't remember which thrift store i found it at...</p>

<h4>Ruby Rox dress</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03947.jpg" />
<p>size 3. not incredible quality but definitely my style. there was a "petti" at the bottom, but i cut it out and now i just wear my actual petti with it. bought it at burlington coat factory for $30 when i was looking for a homecoming dress in high school.</p>

<h3>skirts</h3>

<h4>Liz Lisa skirt</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03958.jpg" />
<p>size 1. lazily altered to have a smaller waist. i have no idea why this was in a goodwill in my hometown but i bought it anyway. it was disgustingly yellowed and dirty but only $4.</p>

<h4>Jantzen Classics skirt</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03943.jpg" />
<p>size 8. altered to have a smaller waist. goodwill find.</p>

<h3>sweaters</h3>

<h4>Alfred Dunner sweater</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03928.jpg" />
<p>found at your grandma's estate sale.</p>

<h4>Blind Date Casual sweater</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/aufrege.gif" />
<p>I'm way too embarassed to wear this outside because I KNOW people will ask me what it says and i dont want to tell them.</p>

<h3>outerwear</h3>

<h4>earth music & ecology Premium Label coat</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03941.jpg" />
<p>size m. found for $17.99 at my favorite thrift store. sleeves altered to fit my short arms!</p>

<h4>deb coat</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03931.jpg" />
<p>size s. i believe it was $15 at goodwill. deadstock. i had to tighten all the buttons when i got it because they were all falling off. the lining keeps coming apart at the seams. it needs so much attention. has a detachable hood.</p>

<h4>PJK denim jacket</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/pjkjacket.gif" />
<p>size s. i'm not actually cool enough to pull this one off. it was like $4 at goodwill</p>

<h4>baby alpaca scarf</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03960.jpg" />
<p>ryan bought this for me ;u; its so cute and its made out of baby alpacas</p>

<h4>scarf and hat set</h4>
<img src="img/wardrobe/HAT03962.jpg" />
<p>peter got this for me for christmas in 2019! its beautiful and handwoven but it definitely takes more effort to wear since it doesnt match anything pink. made by Geke P. De Vries </p>
