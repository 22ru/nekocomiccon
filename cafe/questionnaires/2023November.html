    <ol>
        <li>Why do you like BJDs?</li>
        <p>They're made to be customized, they're large, they're high quality. Other dolls? Forget it!</p>

        <li>What do your friends think of your dolls/dolls in general?</li>
        <p>Unless they also collect dolls, they hate them.</p>
        <li>Dollie shoes! Show us how many you have!</li>
