    <p>Found on <a href="https://aaronstjames.livejournal.com/88163.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Random · Ephemera</a>. The blank version is <a href="#blank">here</a> for you to fill out yourself!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>List your Crew!</li>
        <p>Hina, Liam, Verona, Cheby, Rio, Praline, Sochi, Hikari, Grassy and more??</p>
        <li>Who was your first doll? Do you still own him, her, or it?</li>
        <p>My little goblin Rio is still with me and mostly unchanged from his original state.</p>
        <li>Who is your favorite doll?</li>
        <p>Little Hina ;_______; she is so sweet. She immediately displaced Sochi on arrival. My dream came true!!</p>
        <li>Which doll do you hope or plan to buy next?</li>
        <p>F101? RG Williams? They're both far in the future. I'm feeling a doll shaped void in my life right now though....</p>
        <li>Quick! You've instantly got $800 and must choose a doll to spend it on right now or it's gone forever! Who do you pick?</li>
        <p>Punk Kiki. I'm not even going to get close to using the full $800 and I'm going to buy a tiny. ;~;</p>
        <li>Quick! You've instantly got enough money for any one and must choose a doll to spend it on right now or it's gone forever, but this time you have to buy the doll for someone else! Who gets the dolly, and what do you get them?</li>
        <p>hors gets one WS SD17 Max/Reggie, but this time he has nekomimi, only SDGrB-H-08, and has to wear a maid outfit. nyaa.</p>
        <li>Are you currently waiting on any dolls, heads, or bodies?</li>
        <p>I'm waiting on a few dolls, but none of them were purchased by me, or will be owned by me. Please, dolls, hurry home to Vega!!!</p>
        <li>Do any of your dolls seem to like you to the point that they are infatuated with you?</li>
        <p>Liam often gives me THE LOOK, but I'm pretty sure he'd give THE LOOK to anyone.</p>
        <li>Do any of your dolls seem to dislike or even hate you?</li>
        <p>Cheby is just tsundere! He loves me!</p>
        <li>Who's your most expensive doll at the time you purchased them, not counting items you bought separately for them?</li>
        <p>Hina by far.... She's my favorite though so worth it!! Smoochies forever for the one who took a percentage of my annual income!</p>
        <li>Who's the least expensive doll you own?</li>
        <p>Grassy Knoll was just over $100 after shipping. Did I realize I don't like tinies when I bought him? Was the deal that good?? The deal was really good...</p>
        <li>Is there a limit to what you'd spend on a doll?</li>
        <p>idk like $30k USD? Given that I have that much disposable income at the time. Someday...</p>
        <li>Which doll did you wait for the longest for so far?</li>
        <p>Hina ;_________; oh my god volks please that was a terrible wait</p>
        <li>Which doll had the shortest wait so far?</li>
        <p>Only counting new dolls from the company and no secondhand, Verona was less than a month?! Insane!!</p>
        <li>Who's the biggest doll you own?</li>
        <p>That dang Rio. Absolutely massive, lanky, and awkward. If you think he looks good in photos, it's 100% pure magic.</p>
        <li>Who's the smallest doll you own?</li>
        <p>I... I don't know... I don't even have Olivia here to compare heights... I'm sorry...</p>
        <li>Got any floating heads? If yes, how likely are they to receive bodies anytime soon?</li>
        <p>I have faceplates, but no heads. The faceplates will never get their own bodies. If I had heads, their likeliness to get a body soon would be "no".</p>
        <li>Got any floating bodies?</li>
        <p>Liam still has his old body as well as his SD13B body! I could technically sell it, but I'm in no rush and undecided.</p>
        <li>Do you have any extra, unclaimed pairs of eyes? How many if so?</li>
        <p>23 pairs, plus 7 homemade pairs for Praline that didn't make the cut.</p>
        <li>Do you have any extra, unclaimed wigs? How many if so?</li>
        <p>Like wigs that aren't currently being worn? They tend to swap out. There's 13 extra of varying quality in quick access and a few more in deep storage.</p>
        <li>Anything you've said "never" to in the hobby that you later gave in to?</li>
        <p>I'm never buying Volks!!!!</p>
        <li>Do you own dolls that aren't BJDs?</li>
        <p>Yes, but they aren't nearly as important to me. I have a couple Licca, an 18 inch sekiguchi, a couple baby dolls, a stupsi...</p>
        <li>What was your last doll-related purchase?</li>
        <p>4mm elastic cord</p>
        <li>What do you expect your next doll-related purchase to be?</li>
        <p>God willing, Volks News 101</p>
        <li>What was the last doll-related thing to arrive to you by mail?</li>
        <p>Volks News 100</p>
        <li>What was the last doll-related thing you purchased in person?</li>
        <p>Oh man.... I made Evan buy me a DDS SS bust at Anime Expo 2015. If that doesn't count, probably a faux fur wig at PNW BBQ Expo 2014.</p>
        <li>Not counting floating heads, floating bodies, and anything on layaway (paid off dolls count), how many dolls do you own?</li>
        <p>12?! Only 12! Phew...</p>
        <li>The quiz is over! Any last words?</li>
        <p>Don't buy 50 dolls. DEFINITELY do not buy 100 dolls!!!</p>
