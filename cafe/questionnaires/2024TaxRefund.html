    <p>November 인놀 play: Another month of nofoto? Almost. I prioritized packing dolls over clothes and taveled to the other side of the state with Liam, Volta, Hina, and Cheby and a very limited wardrobe. Verona was left for his own safety and lack of space. You're not going to believe this, but he is extremely precious to me!</p>

    <p>Dolls and people: You thought you were getting a photo of me today? Tricked!!</p>
    <img src="../../img/sak2024/IMG_5412.jpg" />

    <h4 class="date">12/16/2024</h4>

    <p>Hanbok doll play: None. Didn't happen. Won't happen.</p>
    
    <h4 class="date">12/18/2024</h4>
    <p>Doll play outside of the house: Cheby is not a Kpop fan! Taken at the Tacoma Mall.</p>

    <img src="../img/gallery/cheby/IMG_0211.jpg" />

    <p>Cheby has been in public the most. I'm not deathly afraid of breaking or losing him since he's the cheapest and easiest to replace. If I lose a finger, I'm going to groan hard when I have to buy him another $100 body, but I'd still do it. If I mess up his faceup, I'll just redo it. Thanks for being an easy doll!</p>
    
    <h4 class="date">12/19/2024</h4>
    <p>Group doll play: In addition to attending the Sakuracon meetup, I also got to have doll fun with my bff!</p>

    <h4 class="date">12/21/2024</h4>
    <p>Solo/couples photo shoot: A solo shoot of Hina with her accessory, Liam. Oops, had to use the same shoot 3 times already in this...</p>
    <img src="../img/gallery/lifehack/LOL08729.jpg" />

    <h4 class="date">12/22/2024</h4>
    <p>Face or full body photo: I thought this prompt was too easy, but it turns out that I usually don't do only face or full body. Surprise?</p>
    <img src="../img/gallery/rio/LOL09595.jpg" />
    
    <h4 class="date">12/23/2024</h4>
    <p>Black and white photography: I feel like it would be cheating to just apply a greyscale filter over an image I already have, but here goes nothing!!</p>
    <img src="../img/gallery/cheby/CIA02407.jpg" style="filter:grayscale(1);"/>

    <h4 class="date">12/24/2024</h4>
    <p>Doll from behind or body parts: I can't believe I wasted the one I wanted to use for this on 12/20!!!!!</p>
    <img src="../img/gallery/liam/CIA02763.jpg" />

    <h4 class="date">12/25/2024</h4>
    <p>Dolls made by me: Looks like I never even posted the outfit I made for Praline this year. It makes her look fat due to being closed with 2 snaps, which is bulky on a doll this size.</p>
    <img src="../img/gallery/praline/LOL09061.jpg" />
    
    <h4 class="date">12/26/2024</h4>

    <h4 class="date">12/29/2024</h4>
    <p>December 인놀 play: I didn't make anything in December, but I took advantage of the Christmas tree as a photoshoot location many times. The best pictures turned out to be Volta capturing the Elf on the Shelf imho.</p>
    <img src="../img/gallery/volta/CIA03470.jpg" />

    <h4 class="date">12/30/2024</h4>
    <p>Proud of playing with dolls: I am ridiciously proud of Volta's high waisted pants but not proud enough to post a picture of his doll butt in them. I do have a photo of him laying in a pile of mockups though...</p>
    <img src="../img/gallery/volta/CIA02376.jpg" />

    <h4 class="date">12/31/2024</h4>
    <p>Next year's wishes: I hope that Volta will be in a presentable state before the end of 2025! I want to bite the bullet and make however many mockups it takes to make him at least one full outfit. And sock garters!!! I would love to make Draven or Fries, but I would really like to have a home to put them in before they exist. If they don't happen, that's fine too! I will always be looking for Fries though.</p>
