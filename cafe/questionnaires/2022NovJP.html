    <h2>"Answer as many times as the doll owner likes"</h2>
    <h3 class="date">Completed November 27, 2022</h3>

    <p>This questionnaire first appeared on Twitter on <a href="https://twitter.com/ra_cco/status/1592112088385998848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 14, 2022</a>. All translations are by google and edited by me for clarity. I do take constructive criticism. The blank version is <a href="#blank">here</a> for you to fill out yourself!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>うちの子は全部で何人？ How many dolls do you have in total?</li>
        <p>11 BJD, 2 not-quite-BJD, 2 Licca, 5 other. Also a pile of barbies and other dolls in my mom's basement. Let's go with 20?</p>

        <li>好きなスキンカラーは？ What is your favorite resin tone?</li>
        <p>I can't choose between NS and WS. WS has a more radiant feeling, but both are good. Paper white isn't what I mean by white either. Praline does not count!</p>
        <p>Now I have no idea what color I'll decide on for my 58chan...</p>

        <li>3.うちの子の設定はある？ Do you have backstories for your dolls?</li>
        <p>All of the 1/3rd resin dolls have some sort of story to them. No one smaller does. The first three boys had profiles and characters written from when I was a teen. I no longer write stories or comics about them, but their relationships kind of developed in my head anyway. I can't say I won't draw them though.</p>
        <img src="../img/gallery/lifehack/HAT08762.jpg" />
        <p>I moved away from thinking of stories for them for a long time, but it is really fun to imagine Liam leaving Hina at the altar to run off with his ex bf Verona. (Not yet canon)</p>

        <li>ドールの名前の決め方は？ How do you decide on your dolls' names?</li>
        <p>They're mostly from songs, locations, or just cute!</p>

        <li>いつかお迎えしたい子は？ Which doll would you like to buy someday?</li>
        <p>58chan. Codi, do your best! Cheby needs a girl!</p>

        <li>ドールとお出かけする？ Do you go out with dolls?</li>
        <p>Not unless it's to take photos. I'd also take them out for a meetup!</p>

        <li>リアクロ派、ドレス派？ Do you prefer casual clothes or dress clothes?</li>
        <p>Dress clothes but I'm not skilled enough to make them yet.</p>

        <li>ドールに触れる頻度は？ How often do you play with your dolls?</li>
        <p>I take the ones in my chest out for smoochies at least a couple times a week.</p>
        <p>Others may not see the light of day for months.</p>

        <li>よく利用するショップは？ What shops do you frequent?</li>
        <p>None...</p>

        <li>撮影で気をつけていることは？ What do you pay attention to when shooting?</li>
        <p>Getting at least one eye in focus. I want to improve at creating natural and more interesting poses though.</p>

        <li>あると便利なドール用品は？ Do you own any items that make doll ownership or photography more convienent?</li>
        <p>Crochet hooks, a piece of wire bent in half, a hairbrush and comb (not used on human hair), and toothbrush.</p>

        <li>お着替えさせる頻度は？ How often do you change their clothes?</li>
        <p>Depends on what they're wearing. It takes at least half an hour to get Hina in her kimono, so if I put that on, it's staying on for a few months.</p>
        <p>The boys don't really have much to switch out into but sometimes I'll swap pieces between them.</p>
        <p>I haven't played much with my minis so I don't think they've been changed in a year.</p>

        <li>どんな写真の雰囲気が好き？ What kind of atmosphere do you like in photos?</li>
        <p>I really love to look at the landscape + doll photography. I do none of this myself.</p>

        <li>ドールと行ってみたい場所は？ Where would you like to take your dolls?</li>
        <p>I want to take Hina to Tenshi no Sato for an omukae ceremony ;________;</p>

        <li>一番お金を掛けているのは？ What do you spend the most money on?</li>
        <p>The doll itself. I'm too stingy to spend money on anything else. It's a curse.</p>

        <li>今一番欲しいものは？ What do you want most right now?</li>
        <p>New wigs, shoes, and eyes for my current dolls. I know where I would get wigs but I'm stumped on everything else.</p>

        <li>好きなポージングは？ What is your favorite pose?</li>
        <p><a href="https://i.discogs.com/vXkOzB7TxquQgvU1yp_rscVD8DroH59U-5k7gf9NTA4/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:584/w:319/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTE0NTA2/ODAtMTMyNTU1ODE1/NC5qcGVn.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This one</a>. I'm gonna need another girl. Wait, can I get my boys to do this??</p>
        <img src="../img/gallery/lifehack/LOL01236.jpg" />

        <li>ドール服収納どうしてる？ How do you store doll clothes?</li>
        <p>In the cardboard photo boxes they sell at Joanns, Hobby Lobby, etc. I also store wigs, shoes, and other accessories in them. Mine are a little full now...</p>

        <li>推しメーカー、推しヘッドは？ What company and face sculpt do you recommend?</li>
        <p>Wow!! You want a Lieselotte?! Good choice!</p>
        <img src="../img/gallery/hina/HAT08083.jpg" />

        <li>一年で最高何人お迎えした？ How many dolls have you received in one year?</li>
        <p>I received 3 and a head in 2009. I received 3 in 2010. Yikes...</p>
        
        <li>好きなスタジオは? What is your favorite studio?</li>
        <p>I haven't taken my dolls to a photo studio, so I will say the cherry trees nearby when they are in bloom.</p>

        <li>今後撮ってみたい写真は？ What kind of photos would you like to take in the future?</li>
        <p>Ones that tell a little story between the dolls in the photo.</p>

        <li>うちの子の中で最推しがいる？ Do you have a favorite among your dolls?</li>
        <p>Hina. hina hina hina.</p>
        <img src="../img/gallery/hina/HAT00190.jpg" />

        <li>どんなシチュの撮影が好き？ What kind of situations do you like to convey in your photos?</li>
        <p>Goofy ones like Praline in dumb situations.</p>
        <img src="../img/gallery/praline/LOL00582.jpg" />
        <p>I secretly love shipping my dolls... Shh.... Those are a secret and you might have to go searching for those.</p>

        <li>一目惚れでお迎えしたことは？ Have you ever bought a doll on first sight?</li>
        <p>I've never been to a physical BJD store so I can't say I've picked up a coordinate model or in stock doll. Sochi would probably be the closest. I saw my friend had her listed on DoA and asked her to bring her. I paid for her after assembling her.</p>

        <li>行く又は行ってみたいイベントは？ What events do you want to go to?</li>
        <p>Any Japanese event! Dolpa would be great, but the non-Volks events would also be fun. The dealers halls in Japan are much more creative than the ones in the US.</p>

        <li>今後挑戦してみたいことは？ What do you want to try in the future?</li>
        <p>A DearSD. I can't tell if I would love her like my 1/3rd dolls though. I might enjoy my 1/3rd scale dolls because they look closer to adults and I can make my own little stories about them together. DSD are beyond cute but perhaps too young for me to enjoy thinking of a backstory for.</p>

        <li>お迎え待ちの子はいる？ Do you currently have any dolls on order?</li>
        <p>I am waiting for nothing from anyone.</p>

        <li>お洋服は買う派？作る派？ Do you buy clothes or make them?</li>
        <p>I mostly make them! I have some old pieces from 10 years ago that were purchased but I do enjoy making clothes for them myself.</p>

        <li>あったらいいなと思うドール用品は？ What doll items would you like to own?</li>
        <p>Hands! More hands! I would kill to have a set of hands for each of my boys. The iplehouse oYID static sausage hands make shooting so much less fun. I wish I had at least fists for them.</p>

        <li>ウィッグとアイは固定派？非固定派？ Do your dolls have a permanent pair of eyes or wig?</li>
        <p>Hina's heterochromia was temporary at first but now she's stuck with them. I can't imagine her without them anymore. Liam really needs a new wig, but I don't really share his wig with anyone else. Everything else can be swapped at any time.</p>

        <li>撮影使用機材は？ What equipment did you use?</li>
        <p>Sony a7II, Canon FD 50mm f/1.4, 2 selfie ringlights, LED string lights, gameboy camera, a couple lens filters. Some doll stands too!</p>

        <img src="../../img/2YQZCEDj.jpg" />

        <li>フォロワーさんとしてみたいことは？ How do you like to interact as a follower?</li>
        <p>I hate being a follower and would rather be a friend if I am speaking to you. My interactions will be limited to saving your photo or linking your site if I am not talking to you.</p>

        <li>うちの子はオーナーを認識してる？ Does your doll recognize you as its owner?</li>
        <p>Hina is my boss and I can tell when she refuses to cooperate during photoshoots.</p>

        <li>地雷はある？ Do you have any touchy subjects?</li>
        <p>Doll shoes? My hot takes on many doll companies? Choo? Do not talk to me about Danny Choo.</p>

        <li>リアルな友達にドールオーナーはいる？ Are there any doll owners you spend time with in real life?</li>
        <p>Not really anymore. My best friend has dolls and I see her maybe once a year, but we don't bring dolls to each other.</p>

        <li>撮影は室内、スタジオ、野外派？ Do you shoot indoors, in the studio, or outdoors?</li>
        <p>Indoors and outdoors. I don't even think I could afford a studio if I did have one accessible to me.</p>
