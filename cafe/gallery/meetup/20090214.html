            <p>It was Valentines Day and I had convinced my mom to take us (me, Amanda, and my imouto) up to Radcon for the day.</p>
            <p>We went out to eat with Rei and maybe Bri at IHOP. I think this was the year Rei was wearing her homemade "Singles Awareness Day" shirt.</p>
            <p>There was a bit of a meetup in Rei's hotel room. I think another collector from Spokane was there too.</p>
            <p>This tan boy is Harth, a Angell-Studio Gavin Sun. The mini hair clips in these pictures are all my fault.</p>

            <p>DOC Si, Bambicrony Kumi(?), Domadoll Okja, and a DaisyDayes Centaur (?) in the back. All owned by Rei.</p>

            <p>It kind of seems like <a href="http://www.domadoll.com/okja/domadoll.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okja</a> was one of the first "plus-sized" BJD.</p>

            <p>I made some undewear for my upcoming doll and I found out early there was no way they were going to fit him! Here they are on another doll's head.</p>
