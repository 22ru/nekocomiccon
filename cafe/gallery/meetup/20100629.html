            <p>The date of this one is definitely wrong. I'm using the date I uploaded these to facebook since I didn't have internet access until I got back from the trip.</p>

            <p>I think I asked in the meetup subforum on DoA if anyone lived on Maui before a trip there. A user responded and we agreed to meet up! She brought a few friends and I brought my mom and sister. Their usernames were kitsune, Crescent_P, cheshire_kitty, rayne, and axoloti. i think?? i cant remember who all was there</p>

            <p>I'm going to try to guess the sculpts based off each person's doll family list in their profile.</p>
            <p>Axoloti's DOD Homme Ducan/Crobi/Soom Amber hybrid, kitsune's Volks Cyndy, cheshire_kitty's CP Juri 05</p>
            <p>BF or early AR boy, Lati Lami or Pury, my LTF Leah, kitsune's Volks Isao Nanjou</p>

            <p>I remember walking down the main street in Lahaina with them, but that could just be my memory failing me.</p>

            <p>it was so fun to meet with them! they were all wonderful and so friendly! I'm so glad they were willing to meet with a random underage doll lover on the internet.</p>
            <p>If i ever did go back to maui, i would love to meet with them again! I'm sorry I can't remember more details about this one.</p>
