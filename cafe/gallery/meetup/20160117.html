            <p>Some people on DoA were talking about having a Seattle meetup. They managed to get a date all planned and as the day was coming up, I asked if anyone was actually planning to attend since no one had actually committed to coming. No one involved in the planning responded, but a few other people agreed to come.</p>

            <p>This minifee girl was owned by a girl from Portland who was already in the area with her husband or boyfriend for a visit.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry I don't know any of the sculpts or owners. I never met with any of these people again.</p>

            <p>Just as everyone was packing up and leaving, another girl showed up for the meet. I agreed to spend some more time with her so we went to Starbucks and chatted.</p>
            <p>I believe she went by "winxtoysanddolls" or something like that. She brought her doll she bought from Culur at Resin Rose. I think the doll is a Leekeworld Elf Daisy. She said she bought the doll out of peer pressure and that made me a little sad.</p>
            <p>She unfriended me on facebook a few days later so we didn't keep in contact.</p>
