	<h2>Gee Liam! How come your mom lets you have two bodies?</h2>

            <p>I wasn't expecting to buy a body for him so soon, but the DoA user in California who I bought Cheby's body from posted a 2006 PS White long leg SD13B with tabi feet and I couldn't even dream of something working out that perfectly. </p>
            <p>She's a great seller too. Unbelievably fast, answers questions, and isn't wishywashy. Also good for a chat! INSTABUY</p>
            <p>I actually had an audience for this box opening! My mom was visiting for the weekend+. She hates my boys so she really didn't care.</p>
            <p>A giant hole in the side of the box is always a good start to a box opening!</p>

            <p>I was very excited to see what Naruto stuckers nikittin sent me this time! We have one Naruto and one SasuNaru!</p>
            <p>Also shipping went up $4 since she sent me the last body in November ;_; にょろーん</p>

            <p>I had to open from the bottom to preserve the stickers for later extraction. They can now be found in my long winded diary (as opposed to my daily minutiae diary).</p>

            <p>When I purchased the body, I told Ryan he wouldn't notice the item I bought but he walked in during the opening, said nothing, and walked back out.</p>

            <p>Unwrapped pieces plus Liam's head. I am all about those tabi feet.</p>
            <p>I was very relieved to see he is indeed Volks matching after all of Vega and my research. Vega's research confirming mine was what gave me the confidence to pull the trigger.</p>
            <p>My mom got to witness me trying to figure out if R meant my right or his right. I did it wrong the first time and it looked off. It's stage right. I had to use Hina for reference.</p>

            <p>Here is the yellowing progression of Volks PS White. 2006 on top, slightly yellowed in middle, and 2021 on the bottom. Liam's headcap is included as well. He's a tad lighter than the body, but he looks to be in same progression. Can you believe Hina will be this color?? I wonder if they'll converge someday. Maybe I'd better look for the SD/SD13B nakayoshi hands...</p>
            <p>I didn't take a photo, but his oYID body is lighter than both his head and the SD13B body.</p>
