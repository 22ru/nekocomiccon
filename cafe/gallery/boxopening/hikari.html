		<p>once upon a time, it was moderately difficult and expensive to get an unoa</p>

		<p>i learned about mandarake and dollyteria and found out they werent so impossible to get after all. i watched and waited and finally a sist popped up! i bought her for a wonderful price which now would be considered $100 too much, but then was insane</p>

		<p>she came completely unassembled. she had to sit in her box for 8-10 years before being put together. i love kits! i wish more companies offered them. i wish i had bought a volks kit back in the day too</p>

		<p>lusis was always my love, but i figured finding a lusis faceplate would be much more simple than finding a full lusis. the item came with extra faceplates which i assumed was sist bully, sist sleeping, etc, but was 2 of the boys, oyasumi, and lusis! i was so happy! I love oyasumi so i was happy she was in the set as well</p>
		<p>the other faceplates were B-El oyasumi and a terribly modded B-Li (which i further destroyed trying to fix). i will probably never use either of them.</p>
		<p>now, there is an issue with these kinds of faceplate systems. the faceplates may not fit perfectly on the headback or even fit at all! the solution is to place the faceplate in boiling water for 30 seconds and then put it on the headback and leave it until it cools. more stubborn faceplates may need 1 minute</p>

		<p>she was already quite evenly yellowed when i got her and she still is my most yellow doll. it doesnt bother me though and i love her very much. she was a dream come true!</p>
