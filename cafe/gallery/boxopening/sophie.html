		<p>she is my mom's (technically)</p>
		<p>a woman on the marketplace had her up for a while, saying that she needed money for medical reasons. she was listed for at least $300 or so, but i didnt have a ton of money at the time. i politely offered her $200 or so, saying i understood if that was way too low. she accepted though. i hope shes alright out there. i feel bad i couldnt offer her more at the time.</p>

		<p>my big issue with bambicrony girls is that theyre smaller and thinner than yosd sized dolls, so most yo clothes and wigs dont fit! very annoying! it makes me not want to shop for them at all since they cant share with my unoa or my littlefee</p>

		<p>every time i see another tan elf charity pop up i have to remind myself i dont need triplets</p>
