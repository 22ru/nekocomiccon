            <p>This doll was hell to wait for. I thought I'd be able to handle it. Volks DID have a fairly accurate estimate, but waiting 9 months for a doll is too much for me. Thanks to this learning experience, I now know I am not fit to be a mother! Seriously though, I'm not doing this again. I'll have to work something out secondhand if Volks decides to make another preorder that I can't resist. I even went with VolksUSA who always has an extra month or so of wait time. </p>

            <p>The (very cute) UPS girl brought her to my door at 1642538220 unix time, which happened to be 10 minutes before I left for work! I knew I wouldn't be able to do it in time so I hugged her box and left. Her wait time ended up being 395376 minutes if my math is correct. I was just about to leave and force Ryan to spend the day staring out the window for me, but he lucked out! I actually woke up around 7 too excited to sleep this morning! UPS didn't even start their routes until 9.</p>

            <p>The original VolksUSA estimate was "Winter 2021" which, as you know, is about 2 weeks long, if you're not including January, Feb, or March. I was hoping and praying that maybe a miracle would happen and she'd show up late fall because Volks would be so prepared. The Rena Ryuuguu and MEIKO preorders did end up coming out early like that! They didn't seem to be nearly as popular as expected.</p>

            <p>As a sidenote, Galerie de l'esprit is not a real fashion brand and is just a Volks creation. There seems to be confusion about this and I have found nothing on this "brand" outside of Volks. I miss the days when we got real BTSSB collabs!</p>

            <p>VolksUSA sent out an update around November saying Lucia would be shipped late December and Lieselotte/Charlotte would be shipped late January. Mid January rolled around and finally someone on DoA said their Lucia had shipped. I was pretty annoyed at this point because I figured Lieselotte and Charlotte were on the NEXT shipment and I wouldnt see her for another month! It turned out to not be the case, thank god!! In the end, she did end up showing up within 20 days of the original estimate so I can't be mad about it. I know the port situation in LA is not ideal right now.</p>

            <p>I accepted the wait because I didn't think it was possible for me to get a Lieselotte for under $1k, which I still believe is true unless I were somehow lucky enough to win a lottery for her. I've lost every lottery I've entered so the announcement of a preorder was a blessing! I also still believe that if I were to get any Super Dollfie, it should be Lieselotte. Her smile really brightens my day and she's been my favorite SD since I first laid eyes on her in 2013. She was the first Volks doll I've ever fallen in love with.</p>

            <p>The little brown cardboard box at the bottom is empty btw.</p>

            <p>I am happy to announce there was not a single moth inside this box. Also no new resin smell?!</p>

            <p>This release of Lieselotte is by far my least favorite. I honestly don't care for her fullset at all and her faceup doesn't even have a smile this time. They also continued the trend of Charlotte's styling being cuter than Lieselotte's. I'd prefer if I had been able to get one of the releases I love, but this just gives me the chance to make her my own. I'll probably end up wiping her faceup one of these days and making her my version of an ideal Lieselotte.</p>

            <p>Her pillows (2) were wrapped in a sheet of bubble wrap.</p>

            <p>My first glance at my new love! She was sent without any hand protection! That really surprised me but her fingers were all fine.</p>
            <p>This single piece torso is beautiful btw. Her shape is absolutely lovely. She's immature but not too childish.</p>

            <p>Finally freed! Ryan was quite upset that I had her out without a wig or clothes for 20 minutes while I looked at her. She does have KIPS preinstalled in her neck, shoulders, and upper elbow joint.</p>

            <p>Full box contents! I still haven't opened any of her fullset. I'm not sure I will ever put it on her but I will inspect the quality later. There were a few issues with Snow Miku's clothes not being well made so I don't want to just set it away without checking. I'll probably end up using the shoes since they're pleather and pleather has a limited lifespan.</p>
            <p>There's a few places on her body that don't feel as smooth as I expected. I'm going to look at them in daylight before making any judgements though. She has seams of course, but I would have been extremely surprised if she didn't! None of them are nasty or sharp.</p>
            <p>After checking the rougher spots, all of them seem to be gate marks that weren't sanded 100% smooth. I do not think many people would notice these without looking for them. They're hard to see but you can feel them with your fingertips.</p>
            <p>Update on clothes quality: All of her outfit is very well made and soft. Her shoes are pleather ofc, but the soles and heels are a very cheap looking shiny plastic. Not luxurious at all.</p>

            <p>All of her paperwork! I'm going to cry as I buy more hands for her but I want more so badly. I still haven't chosen which ones yet! Definitely not SD-H-12 despite them being the best hands offered for SD10/13.</p>

            <p>I did not find this information earlier, so I will include it here. VolksUSA does their own separate preorder for owner exclusive items, which this time is hands and the blushed SD-H-01 hands. SD-H-12 is not included, as usual. There's an extra sheet included with a link to the "event items". I currently don't have access to it, but I imagine user groups will be how to gain access. The deadline to order is February 25 and the delivery date is the end of April. The international site owner exclusive items included an extra default wig as well as the blushed hands.</p>

            <p>Straight into the blonde wig I bought for her a few months ago! I tried her in the seifuku I also bought but I'll need to modify it because her waist is not that of a SDGr or DD girl.</p>

            <p>Her faceup quality is not even close to that of the promo images, which isn't surprising. I'll have to take some better photos during the day. It's a little disappointing but I planned not to keep it anyway.</p>

            <p>She's got blue eyelashes. It's a little strange. If you look under her teeth, the line isn't exactly straight. I don't know how many people will be looking under her teeth though.</p>

            <p>I do see the issue with single jointed torsos after sitting her down in the chair. No matter how beautiful it is, there's no possibility of any slouch! Her feet also don't touch the ground like the boys do. I can't wait to find out how yellow all my dolls are tomorrow...</p>
            <p>Her legs are so white in this that it looks like she's wearing white tights!</p>
