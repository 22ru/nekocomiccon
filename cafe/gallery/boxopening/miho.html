            <p>Well, my geostigma cleared up. So, I bought a SD head. Even though I swore my next would be an MSD. … And also female. Hey, at least I got Olivia. Close enough.</p>
            <p>Oh well. I’m actually kinda content with these three. Except for the part I need a body. But don’t be quoting me in 2 months when I end up buying another one.</p>
            <p>I also found out Sasha is a boys name. Thank you Brüno/ Mr. (german?) Singer, Sasha.</p>
            <p>So there’s my sister, pressuring me to hurry up so we can check out the new play equipment at the park. She let me use her camera cuz my batteries died. And so that is my excuse for the amateur photos.</p>
            <p>Olivia: Is this where babies come from?</p>

            <p>Ooooo, a box. With writing I can’t read.</p>

            <p>A mummy head, tape, and sissy’s value headphones.</p>

            <p>Haha. Excuse the blur/flash/horrid picture/mismatched earrings/missing eyes. Rio has a tiny head, tee hee.</p>

            <p>And here, we must ignore Olivia’s wig lookin’ plopped(and everything else wrong with this picture). Rio’s default wig seems too small to me. And quite messy. :o</p>
            <p>So after my latest discovery, I’ve decide to name him Sasha. (That’s funny, I keep typing Saascha.) And I promise I won’t cross dress him. And I’m having trouble understanding keeping floating heads without bodies or eyes. They seem to be kinda boring to me. I’m a body as soon as I can (find one worthy).</p>
            <p>Btw, the play equipment was lame. The spinny thing made me dizzy. </p>
