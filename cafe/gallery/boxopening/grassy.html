			<p>i found a SF Hana girl on the marketplace for $150 and jumped on it</p>

			<p>the owner messaged me back a bit later and told me the doll was actually on a boy body and she just didnt notice until now.</p>

			<p>sorry for the foot shot but i cant go back and reshoot this photo!!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="memory">
			<img src="../../img/boxopening/hana/IMG_4447.JPG" />
			<p>i asked her for a discount, since i didnt want the boy body as much. she offered me $50 off. i was ecstatic!</p>

			<p>she sent him in the bluefairy box, which was destroyed by the postal service of course. i was not ecstatic</p>
