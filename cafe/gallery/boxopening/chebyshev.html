			<p>Floating heads are seriously such a bad idea. I will never ever make the mistake of buying one again. "I'm [buying] a body as soon as I can (find one worthy)." MY B*TT. Did I even make an attempt? Did I even look? Did I just move right on to the next doll? Again and again?</p>

			<p>13 years 23 days later, the body of my 3rd doll has arrived. After less than a year, I realized I had settled on Miho. Ryu was my true love. I bought Ryu and put Miho's body at the end of my priority list. My acquisition syndrome was out of hand and I bought doll after doll after doll after him while he sat in a box.</p>
			<p>I love the stickers the seller put on the box. My Lee!!!! I don't know how I'll explain this one to the postman if he were to ever confront me on it.</p>

			<p>This is my attempt at falling in love with him. I can't possibly love just a head. If I still don't come to love him, I'll redo his faceup as a last ditch attempt before putting him away for a gift for some child who hasn't been born yet who considers Migidoll Miho to be her Grail 15 years from now. I don't think I've given this doll even a single smooch. I want to love this doll though, so I will give it my all!</p>

			<p>His name was once Sasha. I think Sasha is a wonderful name! But the context behind my choice embarrasses me so much he is now taking on the name Chebyshev. I'm considering giving him a new faceup as well.</p>

			<p>The match is close to perfect in low light. It's more "close enough" in better lighting, but this dude can deal with it. The body is from 12/2003 while the head is Volks matching 2007.</p>

			<p>My current plans for him are taisho roman. I have no idea how to pattern an a hakama let alone an umanori hakama and I have nothing physical to reference either. Hopefully I can find him some very yellow tabi feet and maybe a few extra pairs of hands. This body is OLD. Of course, I was born in 2013 so I wasn't alive for it.</p>
