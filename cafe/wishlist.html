    <h1>an excessively long dolly wishlist that I hope to never fulfill</h1>
    <p>I really don't need any more dolls but that hasn't stopped me from making a page about it! The will be no doll that can ever top Hina for me.</p>

    <p>I'm constantly rearranging to move dolls out of my wishlist and into my not wishlist. It's now reorganized into tiers! Imagine a pyramid if you will or even a pyramid scheme!</p>
    
    <h3>Tier 1: unobtainable</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Ten no Seihai:</b> Volks SDGr Mana様 #00</li>
            <p>Mana-sama's personal Mana-sama dollfie. No other SDGr Mana-sama will suffice (other than my Dream FCS order). Can be seen in almost all of the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVGLj9nfUQAHeuBfgaf40gwEmZNFlZhIj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mana-sama cooking videos</a>.</p>
    
            <li>Volks Mother SD</li>
            <p>dream big</p>
    
            <li>Dream FCS order</li>
            <p>PS EB WS SDGr Mana様 on yumetenshi body. I hope you can parse that one.</p>
        </ol>
    
    <h3>Tier 2: unlikely</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Volks in person FCS order at Tenshi no Sato</li>
            <p>Currently not an option but this doesn't mean it won't be someday. I have lots of time to dream about what I want my doll to look like and I'm going to enjoy every second of it. The cost of this one will be high since it requires going to Japan. Honestly might as well buy an Ever Beauty at that point. I am not willing to settle for an online FCS (I'm gonna end up eating my words on this part).</p>
            <p>I want to be very spicy and order a PS White SDGrB F-101 with A-01 arms. He'll have both FO-01 and FO-02. I'll need hands H-03, H-07, H-08 at minimum. I probably will get him blank because I like painting my own dolls so much.</p>
    
            <li>Volks One-Off Model</li>
            <p>I think it'd be great to win a lottery for one of these! I'd like to win a Kurumi/Miruku, Victorique, Kazuya, Suiseiseki/Souseiseki, or Sapphire. I already love all of these sculpts. I really think it's important to be in love with the faceup of the doll you enter for since it's sacrilege to wipe it (unless damaged). There are many I wouldn't enter for even if I like the sculpt because I don't care for the faceup. I'll let someone else win those ones!</p>
    
            <li>Volks Ai-Tenshi, Rei-Tenshi, or Sei-Tenshi</li>
            <p>I would never buy one but it is my dream to win one! What an honor it is to bring one of these home from Dolpa. I believe being given one is part of the experience of owning one.</p>
    
            <li>Tenshi no Sato omukae ceremony for Hina</li>
            <p>I might be willing to settle for Tenshi no Mado. How big of a pain would it be to bring her to Nippon?</p>

            <li>Rei's DoT Camine, Ness</li>
            <p>I don't want A Camine, I want this Camine! He's not for sale!</p>
        </ol>
    
    
    <h3>Tier 3: reasonable expectations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Kinoko Juice 58chan</li>
            <p>The only doll I have actual plans for ordering. Maybe 2023 will be our lucky year for her release, but I'm honestly expecting 2024.</p>
    
            <li>Obitsu 22 or 24 bodies in natural/flesh </li>
            <p>Upgrade bodies for my Licca-chans. maybe one of each? </p>
    
            <li>Volks Clannad School Uniform</li>
    
            <li>Volks SD Hands and SD-FO-03 (high heel feet) in PS White</li>
            <p>I would love a pair of SD-H-12! If H-09 and H-07 came into my life, I would be into it! Also SD nakayoshi hands. I don't even have 2 SDs and I need them. I mean what if I meet someone with a WS SD/SD13?? I have to be prepared for such emergencies.</p>
    
            <li>Volks SD13B hands in (aged) PS White and (very aged) PS Normal</li>

            <li>Volks SD13B-FO-02 (tabi feet) in (very aged) PS Normal</li>
    
            <li>Volks News Vol.91 (Spring 2021)</li>
    
            <li>Volks HG Glass Eyes Tea Rose with black line 20mm</li>
    
            <li><s>2009-ish SD13B long leg or SDGrB body in PS White</s></li>
            <p><s>I am not a big fan of the oYID body Liam is on and no SD17 bodies were released in PS White until much later. Note to future self who is more adamently searching: SDGrB does not have a specific long leg option. All are long leg.</s> Found 2/17/2023</p>

            <li>Kinoko Juice Shizuku</li>
            <p>It's going to happen sooner or later.</p>

            <li>Kinoko Juice Kiki Hoekuchi head in white</li>
            <p>Alternate head for Praline. Just a reminder to myself to add one in when I order from KJ.</p>
    
            <li><s>Volks SD13 Boy Body (PS Normal)</s></li>
            <p><s>For my Migidoll Miho head that has been sitting in a box since 2009.</s> Found 9/22/2022</p>

            <li><s>KJ Kinoko Eye</s></li>
            <p><s>I originally felt like Praline looked very recast without her original eyes, but I like the pair I made for her so much that I'm not sure I need kinoko eye now.</s> Edit on Feb 5, 2023: Thank you hors!</p>
        </ol>
    
    <h3>Tier 4: within in the realm of possibility</h3>
        <p>They haven't happened yet and if they never do, that's okay too. One-off version or rerelease is fine for the excessively expensive ones. I will not pay above their original price. I hate hybriding so that often stops me from realizing dreams.</p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Alchemic Labo Unoa Rowan Prim</li>
            <p>Let's face it: we all know Gentaro Araki is my favorite sculptor of all time. I really want another doll made by him. I'm not actually too picky between this and Unoss.</p>

            <li><s>Kinoko Juice Kiki Munyukuchi</s></li>
            <p><s>God bless Kinoko Juice for releasing their dolls to the world. Kikipop is great, but now I want the real deal! My hestitation comes from not wanting to replace my Kikipop but not really wanting 2 Kikis. The resin ones are definitely higher quality though. It's only a matter of time before I cave.</s> Edit on August 3rd, 2022: I caved.</p>
    
            <li>SD17 Romantic Glance Williams</li>
            <p>I have him tattooed on my thigh but now I think I should have just bought the doll instead. His name will be Claude Elwood Shannon.</p>
    
            <li>SD Miruku</li>
            <p>I have no idea why they haven't spammed rereleases of her. They sure make a ton of one-offs. I'm choosing Miruku over Kurumi due to resin match with Hina.</p>
    
            <li>Unoss</li>
            <p>Either Aika or Seina is fine. She's a rare pepe. There is not a single modern thing about her and she rarely pops up and goes quick when she does. Her price usually isn't too awful (in Japan). I almost want a modded one because unmodded would be harder to paint, but modding loses some of her original charm. I couldn't bring myself to remove her eyelashes myself.</p>
    
            <li>every Kinoko Juice girl</li>
            <p>In the order: 58chan, Shizuku, Jill, Luna. They are wonderful and blessed. I think I will live without owning the anthro girls, though. Send me pictures of yours!</p>
        </ol>
    
    <h3>Tier 5: dolls I especially enjoy seeing</h3>
        <p>I don't THINK I need to own any of these</p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Angell Studio Biyao</li>
            <p>That is a CUTE smile</p>
    
            <li>Atelier Momoni Momoni</li>
            <p>Her face is so cute!! If I liked owning minis and her body I would probably have ordered one by now.</p>

            <li>Bluefairy Miley on SD10 body</li>
            <p>I will only consider one on the old BF body or a Volks body. BF's new joints are absolutely unacceptable and I want nothing to do with them. Her face is just not quite Sarang so I'm hesitant on her.</p>
    
            <li>Bluefairy Somang</li>
            <p>Of course I like the closed mouth version of my favorite doll.</p>
    
            <li>Chicabi Bebe Bora and Peko</li>
            <p>What sweet faces! I wish they made them in DSD/SD size!</p>

            <li>Chicabi Enfant Peach</li>
            <p>Uh oh!!! Chiabi made a huge cutie!</p>
    
            <li>CP Delf Soony</li>
            <p>I used to regret not getting her before she was discontinued. It's alright! If I ever did end up with another CP doll, I'd hope it'd be her.</p>
    
            <li>Kanadoll Bambi Sr.</li>
            <p>Wait this is just Lieselotte</p>

            <li>Migidoll Flora hybrid</li>
            <p>She's very pretty but I do not like Migi's bodies. She looks like a more mature and less stylized SDGr Sapphire to me. I think the Switch 57 girl body would be the best match for her.</p>

            <li>Petit Soiree Mille feuilles</li>
    
            <li>Soom Dia</li>
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/cotedeto00/status/1565533417403719680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chino Syoko</a> has the most gorgeous smiling Dia named KAI and I can't stop thinking about him.</p>
    
            <li>Soom Humpty-Dumpty</li>
            <p>omfg it's an EGG</p>
    
            <li>Volks DearSD</li>
            <p>I'm not positive if I love SD for their size or because they look more mature. It makes me hesitant to buy one of these. Maybe I'll have to hold one first. I would hope to put a Kurumi, Miruku, or Lieselotte head on this body if I was able to get one.</p>
    
            <li>Volks DD Yui Hirasawa</li>
            <p>Need a big Yui for my Yui collection. Her face is not my favorite and could definitely be more accurate to the anime art. She'll need a new faceup and wig but the fullset is non-negotiable. I'm not really feeling the need for vinyl right now.</p>
    
            <li>Volks DDP Iori Minase</li>
            <p>My fav IMAS! I don't really like the DDP body though. Someone pointed out the weird calf sculpting and I just can't unsee it.</p>
    
            <li>Volks DDS Rin Kagamine</li>
            <p>I'm not a big fan of rin or anything but she has my favorite DD face sculpt. I didn't have an income when she was selling below retail and when I did, her price was insane. For some reason, I didn't feel like purchasing one when her reboot was announced. That's okay!</p>
    
            <li>Volks DDS Yukiho</li>
            <p>My least favorite IMAS but god they did a good job on her. Shes maybe my 2nd favorite DD sculpt.</p>
    
            <li>Volks DDB 9S</li>
            <p>i dont need him i dont need him i dont need him</p>
            <p>I HAVE A CRUSH ON 9S</p>
            <p>im going to make bad choices if i see him for cheap. i still dont need him though. i need him.</p>
    
            <li>Volks DDS Chihaya</li>
            <p>Chihaya is another one of my least favorite IMAS girls, but she has a very good face.</p>
    
            <li>Volks MDD Arle</li>
    
            <li>Volks MSD-F-12 (Misha/Cynthia)</li>
            <p>I can't explain why I love her strange little alien face, sorry. I just do and I'm not alone. I'm going to pretend I'm the first to translate her name as Cynthia.</p>
    
            <li>Volks SD Suiseiseki/Souseiseki</li>
    
            <li>Volks SD Charlotte</li>
            <p>Lieselotte and Charlotte belong together. If you have both, that is great. PLEASE send photos!</p>
    
            <li>Volks SD Mai/F-81</li>
            <p>She's very popular for good reason. A very decent standard release doll!</p>
    
            <li>Volks F-98</li>
            <p>She looks like Mai, only cuter!</p>
    
            <li>Volks SD10 Victorique de Blois</li>
            <p>You cant have Kazuya without Victorique thats just h*cked up.</p>
    
            <li>Volks SD13 Kazuya Kujo</li>
            <p>wtf why is he so cute</p>
    
            <li>Volks SDGr Belldandy</li>
    
            <li>Volks SDGr Sapphire</li>
            <p>She's a gorgeous mix of Lorina and Charlotte</p>
    
            <li>Volks SDGr Lorina / Lorina 2</li>
            <p>I prefer to see custom or one-off faceups over the Junichi Nakahara ones. Lorina 2's open mouth smile is very cute.</p>

            <li>Volks SDGrB Cain</li>
            <p>I think I'm pulling up memories of Ducan when I see him.</p>
    
            <li>Volks PS Bisque Kasumi</li>
            <p>I hope I will be blessed with the chance to look at one in the real life! Maybe if I end up at Tenshi no Sato someday I'll be able to lay my eyes one one of these beauties. I can't imagine I'll ever see one in the US.</p>
    
            <li>Volks SDGrB F-101</li>
            <p>I'm embarrassed to admit I like this boy a lot. He's in my FCS plans if I ever get the chance.</p>
    
            <li>Volks SD17 Max 'n Reggie</li>
            <p>Ridiculously gorgeous boys. Spicy boy Reggie is my favorite between the two, but custom spicy Max is SO GOOD.</p>
    
            <li>Volks Super Dollfie Dream</li>
            <p>If you managed to grab one of these for christ's sake PLEASE start posting pictures of it NOW!</p>
