    <h1>Wishlist for insane people only</h1>
    <p>Can you believe I'm rewriting this?! SMH!!! Does "I'm never buying another doll again" mean anything? No, it really doesn't.</p>

    <h2>final <s>5</s> 4</h2>
    <p>fran hat, you are a fool.</p>

    <h3>Fries - Iplehouse WS Louis x Volks SDB</h3>
    <p>Teen Verona. Iris is honestly pretty close to Louis and I would be willing to work with that head as well. High priority if a head ever appears. This wasn't going to be a "full doll" but I'm lying to myself when I say it's only an alternate head. I love Verona so much.</p>

    <h3>Elise Shannon</h3>
    <p>Candidates:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Migidoll Flora and Angel Flora x SW HD57 small bust</li>
        <li>Alchemic Labo Rowan Prim</li>
        <li>????</li>
        <li>Profit</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Liam's half sister and Volta's wife. Flora is beautiful and has the family resemblance but I'm not sure she'll look good next to her husband. I'll have to see what bodies are available, but she can't be taller than any of the boys, so that rules out quite a few currently sold ones.</p>

    <h3>Draven - Migidoll nuRyu on Exa Omega body</h3>
    <p>Liam and Elise's father. Hopefully Migi will resculpt this head like she did Jina! Resin tone will be sugar white. An extra head and heel legs will also be bought. I'm praying an unassembled kit will be offered at that time. This plan has been hesitantly approved by Mima.</p>

    <h3>The Gardener - Volks Cain or Kohya 荒夜 (Dolpa 20)</h3>
    <p><s>I'm not entirely sure Cain is a different sculpt. Someone will need to take a photo of the inside of their heads to prove it to me.</s> Cain is a different sculpt! But I don't think he has any particular advantage over the other. Tohya and Kohya are dirt cheap right now when they show up. Kohya 1st is Beauty White while Kohya 2nd is White.</p>

    <h2>Experiences</h2>

    <h3>Dream FCS</h3>
    <p>I really don't know what I'd order. I'd probably end up with some monster that never should have existed.</p>

    <h3>Win a one-off</h3>
    <p>I'd like to win one ROMANTIC GLANCE WILLIAMS please!</p>

    <h3>In person FCS at Sato</h3>
    <p>Can't enter for dream FCS without doing an FCS order. Hopefully I'll get the chance to before F-101 shows up on VolksUSA, but I'd probably take an online FCS order at this point.</p>

    <h3>Win an Ai-Tenshi, Rei-Tenshi, or Sei-Tenshi</h3>
    <p>I would never buy one but it is my dream to win one! What an honor it is to bring one of these home from Dolpa. I believe being given one is part of the experience of owning one.</p>

    <h3>Tenshi no Sato omukae ceremony for Hina</h3>
    <p>I might be willing to settle for Tenshi no Mado. How big of a pain would it be to bring her to Nippon?</p>

    <h2>Shopping List</h2>
    <p>I've pretty much decided I'll buy these if I see them for a good price (or at all).</p>

    <h3>Accessories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Volks SD hands and SD-FO-03 (high heel feet) in PS White</li>
        <p>I would love a pair of SD-H-12! If H-09 and H-07 came into my life, I would be into it! Also SDxSDGrB PS White nakayoshi hands. I need them for secret reasons.</p>
    
        <li>Volks SD13B hands in (aged) PS White and (very aged) PS Normal</li>

        <li>Volks SD13B-FO-02 (tabi feet) in (very aged) PS Normal</li>
