    <h1>2025 Doll Plans</h1>
    <p>Posted December , 2024</p>

    <p>First, I will reveal the results of my last doll plans~</p>

    <h3>1. Buy every new issue of Volks News ✔️</h3>
    <p>Got em!!</p>

    <h3>2. Win Williams ❌</h3>
    <p>Debatable. I didn't win or enter....</p>

    <h3>3. More clothes! ✔️</h3>
    <p>I actually made something in Kiki size, can you believe it? My focus has been Volta's Manaist outfit, which has been a bit of a challenge. I also made a jacket and patterned a dress for Hina.</p>

    <h3>4. Locate more leather doll shoes ❌</h3>
    <p>I fully intended to buy more, but LUTS refused to identify leather from non-leather when I asked this year. I have no idea where to look next.</p>

    <h3>5. Fall in love with Anya ❌</h3>
    <p>Who?</p>

    <h3>6. Attend a meetup ✔️</h3>
    <p>Completed at Sakuracon 2024! I saw lots of dolls and met a few owners.</p>

    <h3>7. Buy at least one pair of eyes ❌</h3>
    <p>Debatable. Does it count if the eyes were in a head?</p>

    <p>And on to 2025!</p>

    <h3>1. Volks News *4</h3>
    <p>I'm just putting this in because it's easy to put the check mark next to at this point.</p>

    <h3>2. Complete Volta</h3>
    <p>He's not too far off! I'm not happy with the vest and shirt I made for him, so I need to remake those to be better fitting.</p>

    <h3>3. Get a place to put my dolls</h3>
    <p>Nomadic life is not my favorite.</p>

    <h3>4. Influence a doll purchase</h3>
    <p>( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) </p>

    <h3>5. Create doll gloves</h3>
    <p>Volta needs a pair, but honestly, this is the best way to have another option for Liam's hands.</p>

    <p>Nothing to say for buy/no-buy. I've been pretty good resisting tempation, and if one of the final <s>5</s>4 become available, I'll probably do it regardless of my lack of space. Please let it be Fries.</p>

    <p>May all be blessed by Mother SD.</p>
