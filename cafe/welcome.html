    <h1>いらっしゃいませ~!</h1>
	<p>It has always been my dream to open a wildly unprofitable doll cafe. Please enjoy a drink during your stay. My barista, Cherry, will be happy to assist you! Please be patient with her, she is new and doing her best!</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>House rules: No dogs, no Choo, no recasts! Service dogs and miniature horses are welcome. ESA animals are not. All dolls are free to view, but please do not touch!</p>

    <p>Disclaimer: Due to strict rules on recast images and discussion, I do not recommend linking this site on DoA. This is for your safety, not mine.</p>
