    <h1>Luts order update, March 29, 2023</h1>

    <p>MGS 01 and KDS 23 arrived (no padding).</p>

    <img src="../img/boxopening/lutsmarch23/LOL02624.jpg" />

    <p>The holes in the strap of MGS 01 are not centered well. They do not have quick release functionality. (Nitpicking)</p>

    <p>KDS 23 has no issues with the strap being detached.</p>

    <p>It was fine.</p>
