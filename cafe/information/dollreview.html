    <h1>a review of my dolls</h1>
    <p>The good, the bad, the what in to heckin heckers???</p>

    <p>Height measurements taken flat, no wig, no shoes. Weights are with eyes in, nude, no wig.</p>

    <h2>Bambicrony Tan Elf Charity</h2>
    <p>Can't remember...</p>

    <h2>Dream of Doll DoI Black Elf Sha</h2>
    <p>Height: 67cm, weight: 1,775g</p>
    <p>The first, absolute first thing you will notice about this doll nude is that his head is laughably small. The second you'll notice is the placement of his penis. Perhaps placing it this low makes it easier to wear pants? The world will never know what the sculptor was thinking.</p>
    <p>He has mobility joints, which I have taped together with masking tape. I have never met a doll so happy to turn his thighs around. </p>
    <p>His elbows are double jointed in my least favorite style. However, they are functional. His knees are single jointed. His hands look suspiciously like SD13B-H-01. They aren't recast but the inspiration is obvious.</p>
    <p>He came with multiple imperfections from DoD including a bubble in his pinky and a chip in his inner knee. There's a few small bubbles on the tips of his ears as well. His marbling is awful, but it usually was in those days and not unexpected.</p>
    <p>The back of his headcap is marked DOD.</p>

    <h2>Migidoll Miho head</h2>
    <p>Height (w/ SD13B): 59cm, weight: 1,620g</p>
    <p>His headcap is incredibly unstable and will fall off if you look at it wrong. He has one magnet and one resin hook type mechanism to be caught in a divet in the bottom of the head. My Miho is the early version with no printed serial number. He does not have a Migidoll logo printed inside. He instead has "Miho" written in handwriting.</p>
    <p>The inside of his mouth is not perfectly smooth and there is a small piece of resin that sticks out on the left side. It's not noticable if you paint over it.</p>

    <h2>Iplehouse Louis</h2>
    <p>Height: 62cm, weight: 1,413g</p>
    <p>He has two magnets on each side of his headcap. He has a green Iplehouse logo plate on the back of his headcap. It seemed to be a little fragile when I attempted to remove it.</p>
    <p>This body feels very unskilled. I have many complaints about it.</p>

    <h2>Fairyland Littlefee Leah</h2>

    <h2>Migidoll Ryu head</h2>
    <p>Height (w/ SD13BLL): 61cm, weight: 1,599g</p>
    <p>My Ryu is the early version with no printed serial number. He does not have a Migidoll logo printed inside. He instead has "Ryu" written in handwriting.</p>
    <p>He does not have prominent divets to rest the S hook on. I'm a little surprised it doesn't twist and fall out all the time, but it only does rarely.</p>

    <h2>Bluefairy Shiny Fairy Hana</h2>
    <p>The wrist balls on this body are connected to the arm. There is very limited movement from side to side.</p>

    <h2>Alchemic Labo Unoa 1.0</h2>

    <h2>Volks Super Dollfie Lieselotte</h2>
    <p>Height: 53cm, weight: 1,283g</p>
    <p>The torso on the non jointed SD body is so beautiful. It is obviously immobile when compared to split torsos. Her arms are double jointed and her knees are single jointed.</p>
    <p>The largest defect I found on this doll was discoloration on the back of her neck. There is a lighter spot, but it is mostly covered by her wig and head. There is a defect in her faceup where the line under her teeth is not perfect.</p>
    <p>The one touch system is a blessing from Mother SD. It is in her wrists and feet. I love this feature so much that I bought 3 more Volks bodies.</p>

    <p>Her head sculpt number is "" and her headplate says "".</p>

    <h2>Kinoko Juice Kiki Munyukuchi</h2>

    <h2>Volks Super Dollfie 13 boy body</h2>
    <p>The split torso cannot be moved forward or back, only twisted. No slouching. I sometimes wonder if they should have made a single piece option.</p>
    <p>Most of the parts are labeled "XY3". Each piece is marked R or L, if they are side exclusive. R is your right, not his. The difference between regular leg and long leg is only the length of the shin piece.</p>
