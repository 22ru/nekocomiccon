    <h1>A History of BJD Issues</h1>
	<p>Sometimes, this info is lost to time. ALWAYS check the DoA reviews (<a href="https://denofangels.com/forums/company-reviews-service.91/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">service subforum</a>, <a href="https://denofangels.com/forums/company-reviews-products.147/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product subforum</a>)! I will be collecting accounts here that may not make it into those threads. For some fun reads, check out the <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/worst-doll-experience-ever.515204/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worst doll experience ever</a> thread.</p>

    <p>I am not taking anything that says "DO NOT ORDER FROM" lightly. These companies have serious unresolved issues and it is in YOUR best interest to avoid them like the plague.</p>

    <h3>BJDivas (USA BJD dealer)</h3>

        <h4>GloryBlue Vs. BJDivas (10/16/2023)</h4>

        <p>GloryBlue ordered a D.Lace Raphael fullset for around $1.5k from BJDivas. After 2 years of waiting, the doll arrived <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13141204/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">damaged</a>.</p>

        <p>GloryBlue wrote a little <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13142105/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> about the transaction and provided <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/iej56sn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pictures</a> a few days later. Divas had mistakenly ordered a doll with body blushing and chose to charge GloryBlue for the extra cost, or wait for a new doll to be produced without body blushing. GloryBlue chose to pay the extra cost. It was later noticed that body blushing is included in the fullset already, and not an extra charge at all.</p>

        <p>D.Lace decided to fully paint the doll instead of usual blushing methods. This of course causes the blushing to chip more noticeably and quickly. Unfortunately, the doll arrived completely chipped and rubbed. BJDiva's response to this was basically, it was going to happen eventually, so it cannot be covered as damage.</p>

        <h4>Zest Vs. BJDivas (8/31/2021)</h4>
        <p>A DoA user made a <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/can-i-ask-for-a-refund-2-year-wait-lost-order.846108/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a> asking if it would be too bothersome to ask BJDivas for a refund for their doll they had been waiting for over 2 years for. The overwhelming majority of the thread said yes, of course. A few people came out of the woodwork with a few complaints about BJDiva's service. This includes Zest and Zest had some big complaints.</p>

        <p>BJDivas decided 2 of the posts in this thread were slanderous. They made a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BJDivas/posts/1256111538185287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="i cant actually tell if this link works because i dont have a facebook account">post on facebook</a> about how the posts were completely untrue (one of the posts is pretty speculative) and said they had asked the mods to remove both of these posts. These posts have not been removed and the thread was locked.</p>

        <p>BJDivas decided they no longer wanted to work with Zest. They transferred his preorder back to Dollzone and sent him an email about it. Zest posted in the <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/dollzone-waiting-room-v16.818228/page-40#post-12970577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dollzone waiting room</a> about this and BJDivas responded, ending up in the thread becoming heated and locked for a month. BJDivas took the drama over to their public facebook page where they named and shamed Zest, including his real name. BJDivas claims they only posted his real name because he had already posted it.</p>

        <p>Zest, with the permission of the mods, wrote and posted a review in the BJDivas DoA feedback thread. BJDivas did not like the review, so they posted a rebuttal and asked the moderators to remove the post. They asked on their private facebook group for people to leave feedback for them in their <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/bjdivas.741024/page-4#post-12955027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DoA feedback thread</a> around July 20th, 2021. 33 reviews popped up within the next 2 months, mostly from older orders. Two of these reviews were not positive and BJDivas posted a rebuttal to both. <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/bjdivas.741024/page-4#post-12972767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One of them</a> suggests BJDivas is on a witch hunt for all of Zest's lackeys.</p>

        <p>In a <a href="https://bjdivas.com/update-regarding-targeted-harassment-and-disinformative-allegations/?v=7516fd43adaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on their website</a>, BJDivas even goes as far to blame the DoA mods' unfair judgement on the fact they have not donated to them or bought advertising. BJDivas has claimed that Zest sent his personal army after them. Claiming they are receiving death threats, saying someone tried to shut down their website, etc. This could be true, but they have not posted screenshots of anything as far as I can see. They have decided to not press charges against Zest or DoA. <a href="https://bookerdewittless.tumblr.com/post/667046077306961920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zest says</a> his multiple attempts at contact and chargebacks were due to his order becoming stuck in limbo until he could receive their consent to transfer. Both BJDivas and Zest recieved a 1 month suspension for their argument. BJDivas has recieved a "Dealer Caution" banner as well for their actions. </p>

        <h3 id="culur">Culur Theory</h3>
        <h4>DoA ban (9/2013)</h4>
        <p>You cannot mention or show a photo of a Culur Theory doll there. Culur Theory dolls are not recasts, though recasts of them exist. Culur was banned from DoA for posting a photo her <a href="https://culur-faceups.tumblr.com/post/144596498039/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recast Lorina</a> there. She claimed she didn't think anyone would notice.</p>

        <p>It is the moderation's stance that for any user that is banned, their created dolls are also banned.</p>

        <h4>Can I get an invite?</h4>
        <p>Around the time of Culur's ban, DoA was invite only for quite a while. New users had to be invited by a current user to make an account and the current user would be responsible for the user invited. Culur was found to be asking <a href="https://amaranthscastaways.tumblr.com/post/97566580417/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple users</a> to invite her back to DoA. If they had done so, they would have been banned as well.</p>

        <h4>DC Christina recast for sale</h4>
        <p>There was a big fuss when Culur tried to sell her <a href="https://winonaflammery.tumblr.com/post/97331294018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recast doll</a> without mentioning that it was a recast. She said <a href="https://quezycoatl.tumblr.com/post/97544499756/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she forgot</a>, she didn't think it was important, and that <a href="https://culur-faceups.tumblr.com/post/144596498039/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no one would assume it is legit</a>.</p>

        <h4>My recast doesn't count (2014)</h4>
        <p>My first memory of Culur was at PNW BJD expo. I saw a young girl with a gorgeous minifee in the dealer's room. I found out soon after it was Culur and her minifee was a recast. She didn't really mind that bringing a recast was against the rules of the expo.</p>

    <h3><span style="color:red">DO NOT ORDER FROM</span> Dolk (Japanese dealer)</h3>
        <p>There are an insane amount of issues coming out of this company. Many of them being taking months to ship an in stock doll and charging twice for shipping.</p>

        <h4>Myoudoll Hershey's faceup (10/18/2022)</h4>
        <p>See <a href="#myouxdolk">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Doll Chateau</h3>
        <h4>Disappointing faceup</h4>
        <p>During the release of DC Barbara, a dealer recieved a fullset doll with a <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/12857621/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful rendition</a> of the default faceup.</p>

    <h3><span style="color:red">DO NOT ORDER FROM</span> Dollshe Craft or Club Coco BJD</h3>
        <p>Over so many years in this hobby, I have never ever seen so many unhappy people waiting years for dolls while funding a Ponzi scheme. I can't even choose a few posts to show the misery of the people with open orders.</p>

        <p>As of November 2023, Mr. Dollshe has decided to rebrand as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzJjEwvyprk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club Coco</a> and change his name to "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sculptor_dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Kim</a>".</p>

    <h3>Dollzone</h3>
        <h4>Unevenly yellowed display model for full price (Feb 2025)</h4>
        <p>DoA user IzabethS was feeling very lucky when Dollzone (through New Clover Singing) agreed to sell her a 1/6 Little Snow in purple that they had in stock for $270. For reference, a blank Little Snow in grey resin is $264 on ACBJD at the moment of writing with no current sales or discounts, free shipping as usual.</p>

        <p><a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13217099/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The doll arrived</a> in a damaged Dollzone box. The doll they sent was severely unevenly yellowed and on the boy body, not the girl body as ordered. The head, hands and legs starting at the thighs had lost most of their red pigment.</p>

        <p>Dollzone replied and said the doll was a 2 year old display model. She was offered a 20% refund which Christina of NCS rounded up to $70. IzabathS chose to take this option. </p>

        <p>IzabethS also mentions her last Dollzone doll, <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/11872713/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minas/Sawarieda hybrid</a> (estimated cost $1k USD) ordered in 2016 came in the wrong resin color and Dollzone refused to correct this. Upon further research, <a href="https://bjdcollectasy.com/2015/09/22/sawariedatrieda-and-frieda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BJDCollectasy</a> notes that Sawarieda can only be ordered in white resin, so it is up to you to believe the poster or not on this one.</p>


        <h4>Recasting (2005)</h4>
        <p>In the very very early days of BJD, Chinese company Dollzone jumped in the scene. Dollzone Lynn was a recast of CP's Woori mold. Here is a <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/938418/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DoA discussion</a> on the topic.</p>

        <p>Dollzone is the ONLY former recaster allowed on Den of Angels.</p>

    <h3>CP/FairyLand</h3>
        <h4>Snow flaking and other QC issues (2012 - present)</h4>
        <p>A number of users reported recieving new dolls from Fairyland that had snowflake like patterns in the resin. This was occuring in WS and NS resin, which was generally regarded as a safe option before.</p>

        <p>In 2012, <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/9015789/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bronzepheonix</a> reported recieving a minifee with a headcap that does not fit, floppy head, snowflaking. <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/11833977/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Botflybaby</a> recieved a Realfee body with multiple imperfections in 2016. </p>

        <p>In August 2022, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BJD/comments/wh3htk/is_it_possible_to_fix_the_wonky_warped_minifee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Redditor</a> posted asking how to fix a warped leg on their minifee.</p>

        <p>These issues appear to be ongoing.</p>

    <h3>Forever Doll</h3>
        <h4>Sawdust dolls (2002)</h4>

        <p>This was the first recast company, based out of Hong Kong. The dolls were either molded from SD sculpts or modified versions of them (<a href="http://www.aimeemajor.com/dolls/sdfaq-otherbjdollsq.html#q23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>). Here is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021028221240/http://www.yumia.com.hk/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last archived capture</a> of their homepage from October 2002. Their prices were around $200 for an SD and $130 for an MSD, which in this day would be insane! Volks dolls had to be imported by a proxy service in these days and were already expensive without the fees. Their website claims they had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021004100526/http://www.yumia.com.hk/bimu/showroom.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 showrooms</a>, one in Hong Kong and one in Tokyo.</p>

        <p>Forever Doll was a big topic of disussion on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021019231523/http://groups.yahoo.com:80/group/denofangels/messages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DoA in October 2002</a>! According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090520014022/http://home.att.net/~pinktruck/Volks/jade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Val</a>, these dolls are heavier and prone to chipping. Her website also contains photos of the doll. A DoA user claimed Forever Doll used painted polystone for their dolls, rather than resin (<a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/7125571/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>). The dolls were extremely low quality, often came with broken parts, and degraded quickly (<a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/7460606/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>).</p>

        <p>Volks accused Forever Doll of copying several of their molds and Forever Doll was shut down after legal action.</p>

    <h3>Iplehouse</h3>
        <h4>Pea green soup (May 2009)</h4>
        <p>Warning: disturbing images for owners of tan resin dolls.</p>

        <p>Back in the olden times, tan resins were extremely unstable. A few users did some experimenting with sunlight exposure on iplehouse resins.</p>

        <p>Smilia did a test on <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/4775799/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iplehouse tan</a>, finding greening happened in 2 weeks in the sun and extreme greening had developed in 6 weeks outside.</p>

        <p>A few more users did their own tests on unnecessary resin parts included with their dolls. Eliz-Rivenstar tested <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/4965059/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Realskin</a> and got some very green results in 2 weeks. Twigling tested <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/5350578/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UV-Protected Realskin</a> and got discoloration after just 4 days.</p>

        <p><a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/4923821/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiccat</a> posted her RS Akando that had turned green on the back of his head despite not being exposed to sunlight. <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/5807130/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MadamMauMau</a> observed greening from an outdoor meetup on her Akando as well.</p>

        <p>For a time, <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/5252926/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iplehouse did offer replacements</a> for greened dolls for 60% of the selling price. They <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/5475735/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kept trying to improve the formula</a> saying that it is more resistant to UV. Users seem to agree that for dolls made after October 2009, most of the greening issues were resolved.</p>

    <h3>Jane's Dolland</h3>
        <h4>(Former) recast supporter (pre-2021)</h4>
        <p>I am not at all accusing Jane's Dolland of currently selling recasts, but there is feedback in her <a href="https://feedback.ebay.com/fdbk/feedback_profile/huajan3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay feedback history</a> saying she has sold recasts in the past. It's likely these were her personal dolls and completely unrelated to dealer activities, but it's just something to keep in mind.</p>

    <h3>Loongsoul</h3>
        <h4>Mismatched head (2023/2024)</h4>
        <p>DoA user <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13168206/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">castironteapot</a> ordered a full Cang Jue in NY resin through AC in July 2023. In January 2024, the doll arrived with a WS head and a NY body. Castironteapot was asked to ship the head back to China (shipping paid by AC) and received the correct head in March 2024.</p>

    <h3>Luts</h3>
        <h4>Beauty Green (2005-2006)</h4>
        <p>During the mid-2000s, <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/12776187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least a few batches</a> of "beauty white" dolls produced by this company happened to turn fade into a light shade of <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/12775556/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green</a> instead of the usual yellow. Users started using the term "beauty green" for these dolls, although I'm not sure it was affectionately. The rumor somehow transformed into <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/12233223/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"radioactive green"</a>, but in reality, the dolls were not vividly colored and greening only happened to a few batches from only a few companies. They do look a bit <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/12780427/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sickly</a> next to dolls who are not Beauty Green.</p>

        <h4>Cracked leg (July 2007)</h4>
        <p>Chinese DoA user bread17 reported receiving a <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/2202727/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minifee from Luts</a> that had developed a large crack in her calf part after spending 2 months in the box. She had found that others had also recieved dolls that soon developed cracks and damage. One person she had contacted said their doll was covered in hairline cracks. Luts was willing to replace bread17's calf part, at her cost.</p>

    <h3><span style="color:red">DO NOT ORDER FROM</span> MyDollection</h3>
        <p>This Malaysia-based dealer has had a multitude of problems over the years they've been open. Please read this <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13074969/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a> for more details.</p>

        <p>Currently, the owner of MyDollection is saying they bought the company in April 2024 and do not have access to any of the previous orders. They are recommending filing paypal claims and have are refusing to fulfill the orders.</p>

        <h4>Free worldwide shipping within Malaysia (10/4/2022)</h4>
        <p>DoA user <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13068033/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elzaim</a> posted that she had orded a full box of blind box BJDs from MyDollection during a time when they were offering free worldwide shipping. Months later, the dolls were ready to be sent and MyDollection asked for $78 USD to cover the shipping costs. Elzaim came up with proof that free shipping was being offered at the time, but MyDollection refused to cover it. The resolution was a refund from MyDollection and no dolls.</p>

    <h3>Myoudoll</h3>
        <h4 id="myouxdolk">Myoudoll Hershey's faceup (10/18/2022)</h4>
        <p>A Japanese twitter user ordered a Myoudoll with faceup through Dolk. The doll arrived with possibly <a href="https://twitter.com/kohaku_9090/status/1582338884641226753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the worst default faceup ever</a>. Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/kohaku_9090/status/1582364592654909441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo</a> of the alternate mouth pieces. Myou must have run out of red paint!</p>

        <h4>1/4 v2 bodies can't stand</h4>
        <p>DoA user <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13167659/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anjelle</a> asks how to make her dolls stand better. Many users respond saying their dolls also cannot stand and confirm it's an engineering issue.</p>

    <h3>Souldoll</h3>
        <p>It was my mistake to add Souldoll here as a joke without them having any issues.</p>

        <p>Around Summer 2023, Souldoll became overwhelmed with orders and has a large backlog of unfufilled orders with wait times exceeding a year for some orders. Those who contact Souldoll are given responses saying it will be done in X amount of time, yet do not follow through with their promises and continue to delay.</p>

        <h4>Lost Souldoll Liam (December 2023 - January 2025)</h4>
        <p>DoA user puppymush ordered a Souldoll Liam on layaway in <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13152892/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 2023</a> after an announcement that he would be discontinued. There was a free shipping deal at the time of order. In <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13187976/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 2024</a>, Souldoll had her confirm her address and said they would ship next week. Some time passed without a shipping notice and Souldoll left puppymush with radio silence. In <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13198074/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 2024</a>, Souldoll finally responds to puppymush saying the doll was mailed through FedEx and delivered. It was verified with FedEx that the <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13198104/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delivery address</a> was correct.</p>
        <p>Puppymush contacted Souldoll to ask for a replacement in <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13199833/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2024</a>. She offered to pay for shipping. Souldoll agreed to the replacement. They said they would accept only 50% of the shipping cost and would try to ship the new doll before 2025.</p>
        <p>Souldoll shipped the new Liam via USPS in <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13211543/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 2025</a>. Puppymush paid half of the shipping cost. Some normal shipping anxiety occurred with some customs wait, but the doll finally arrived on <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13213651/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 23, 2025</a>.</p>

        <h4>Greening tan (2021)</h4>
        <p>User puppymush notes in <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13140249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> her experience with discoloration of Souldoll neutral tan. In a month after receiving her doll, she found uneven discoloration on her. Souldoll sent her a new doll with an improved UV protection formula. The new doll turned green in a year.</p>

    <h3>Volks</h3>
        <h4>Pure Skin Ever Beauty (2018 to present)</h4>
        <p>In the issue of Volks News released in September 2018, Volks announced a new "premium class" full choice system offering. They had developed a new resin that resists yellowing far better than their current Pure Skin options. It was tested in direct sunlight in the Amazon and had spectacular results in comparison to Pure Skin with UV protection.This premium resin is offered at a much higher price. </p>

        <p>While it's possible that this resin does hold up very well under the Amazon sun, it does not hold up over time. Many owners have reported extremely fast and uneven yellowing on their dolls.</p>

        <p>Volks has not admitted there is an issue with the Ever Beauty formula and still offers it.</p>

        <h4>Yellowed feet (Personal experience, May 2022)</h4>
        <p>I had ordered a few sets of "owner limited" hands along with a pair of tabi feet from VolksUSA for Hina. Please note that owner limited hands are sent from Japan, while tabi feet are an item kept in stock at most times. After few months, all of the option parts arrived. I was very disappointed to notice the feet were yellow compared to my doll and the hands. They had obviously been produced years ago.</p>

        <p>I contacted VolksUSA about my issue and tried to take a photo showing the color difference between the feet and hands. I truly just wanted a pair that matched my doll, but they were unable to offer me an exchange and offered me only a refund with a prepaid shipping label. I did not take their offer after running my options, but I am very displeased with this transaction. I am hesitant to buy in stock items from them other than Volks News now.</p>

        <h4>Moths (12/16/2021)</h4>
        <p>A Korean twitter user opened her brand new SD Charlotte bought through Haruhana and found moths inside (<a href="https://twitter.com/JinMaeHyang/status/1471726861831262208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JinMaeHyang/status/1471894092938629122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JinMaeHyang/status/1471899956755955712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>). Haruhana agreed to exchange her doll for her, excluding the head because she had already removed the eyes (<a href="https://twitter.com/jinmaehyang/status/1474246196785205248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a>).</p>

        <h4>DD 2B's cracked neckhole (June 2020)</h4>
        <p>Not one, not two, but many people complained that their DD 2B came with cracks in the vinyl of her neckhole. Some were smaller cracks, some were larger (<a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=247861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=247762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=247663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>). 9S did not seem to have these issues. Concern was voiced that the cracks would grow larger over time and cause issues with head looseness, if the head was not loose already. </p>

        <p>A few users on DollDreaming contacted Volks/VolksUSA about this issue. Volks originally claimed that cracks in the neckhole were normal and acceptable. Id still displeased, VolksUSA required the users to ship the heads back to them to inspect the damage. DollDreaming users <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=248307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raine</a>, <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=249743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oyashiro</a>, <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=250497" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mayaiincho</a> did receive a replacement</a>. User <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=248134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growcian</a> did not send his head in and was not offered a replacement.</p>

        <p>There was a rumor of a shipment of Nier:Automata dolls being lost to a sunken cargo ship, but I have yet to see any posts detailing this event.</p>
