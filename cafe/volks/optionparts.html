    <h1>Volks Super Dollfie Option Parts</h1>

	<p>The secret is just to buy them all.</p>

	<p>It's much harder to find matching hands to yellowed dolls so I recommend grabbing a few pairs while your doll is less than 5 years old.</p>

	<p>Some of these hands look better paired together than others. Unfortunately there's not a lot of photos of them together or with details on which hands are being worn.</p>

	<p>Owner limited hands are freshly produced and not back stock. These won't be yellowed. You can usually get the order page if you ask nicely. You do not need to own the doll to order them from Volks Int. VolksUSA will not allow you to order without having the limited doll on your account purchase history. </p>

	<p>Do not order option parts from VolksUSA unless they are from the owner limited page. I was sent a "brand new" pair of feet that I would estimate are over 5 years old and do not match my doll.</p>

	<p>In 2024, for the release of DP50 SD13 Elizabeth and SDGrB Williams, my order for "owner limited" option parts through Volks Int was placed on 4/11 and arrived 6/17. Volks does not accept Paypal for these orders.</p>

	<h2>SD Option Parts</h2>

	<p>H-01 is the least detailed. H-04, H-05, and H-11 have the same level of detail. H-17 and H-18 are more detailed.</p>

	<p>H-05 is the best bet of these if you would like your doll to wear gloves. The fingers are not parted fully to the base of the finger.</p>

	<p>The feet included with my SD Lieselotte are marked FO-00, not 01.</p>

	<h2>SD13B/SDGrB Option Parts</h2>

	<p>H-01, H-03, H-12 have no veining. H-07, H-08, H-10 have subtle veining. H-12 matches the detail level of the later hands, despite not having veining.</p>

	<p>H-01 and H-10 have fully parted fingers and should be able to wear gloves.</p>
