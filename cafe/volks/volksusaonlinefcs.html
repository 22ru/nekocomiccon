    <h1>VolksUSA Online FCS ordering information</h1>
	
	<p>VolksUSA offers online FCS orders periodically. The order periods are not currently consistent. The options are SDM, SD/SD13, SDGrB, and SD16. Five face sculpts are offered for each category and 5 faceup options are provided. The face sculpts rotate, so a couple previously released heads are mixed with unreleased heads to USA. Tan is a resin color option. For SD16 orders, darker shades can be available such as bronze and amber.</p>

    <p>As of the October 2024 renewal, 5 recommeded makeup options are offered and random wigs are now included with recommended makeup, as well as the Zoukeimura eyes that were included previously. You are given the options of short or long length and dark or light color. You can choose recommended makeup, eyelash volume, eye size, eye color, eye placement (if glued), eyelid gloss, and lip gloss. </p>

    <p>I highly suggest ordering high heel feet for SD girl orders if you want them, because they are difficult to get outside of FCS. If you choose to order in stock hand and feet parts from VolksUSA, keep in mind they may be yellowed if the item is not popular enough to rotate the stock.</p>

    <p>The webstore is limited to only selling within North America. For this reason, they have blocked IP addresses from outside these regions from even viewing the online FCS order pages. You'll have to use a VPN or proxy if you'd like to view the ordering process. You won't be able to order if you do sneak in to look. You'll have to find a proxy service if you are so desperate.</p>

    <p>Tax is not charged on orders shipped outside of California. My condolences to Californians.</p>

    <h3>Outdated information for reference</h3>

    <p>VolksUSA offers online FCS orders approximately once every 3 months. The order periods will only allow orders of two categories of dolls. The options are SDM, SD/SD13, SDGrB, and SD16. Five face sculpts will be offered for each category and 2 faceup options are provided. The face sculpts rotate, so a couple previously released heads are mixed with USA unreleased heads. Tan is usually a resin color option, but sometimes with SD16G orders, different darker shades will be available such as bronze and amber. The order periods last the first 10 days of the month. Paypal is the only payment option.</p>

    <p>Prices prior to the October 2024 renewal: <br />
        Basic doll: SDM $374, SD/SD13 $638, SDGrB $770, SD16 $726<br />
        Makeup + Zoukeimura eyes: $110<br />
        Option hands: $28 SDM, $42 SD/SDGr, $59 SD16 (only one extra pair is possible)<br />
        SD16 option legs: $187 regular legs, $88 heeled legs<br />
        Satogaeri services: <br />
        <span style="padding-left: 1em;">Full seam line removal: $44 SDM, $55 SD, $66 SDGrB SD16<br /></span>
        <span style="padding-left: 1em;">Hand seam line removal: $14 SDM, $17 all others<br /></span>
        <span style="padding-left: 1em;">Option hand seam line removal: $14 SDM, $17 all others<br /></span>
        <span style="padding-left: 1em;">Body coating: $39 SDM, $44 SD, $57 SDGrB, SD16<br /></span>
    </p>

    <p>It is NOT possible to order magnetic option parts through this service.</p>

    <p>Makeup is "coordinated" rather than the options offered for FCS. For SDM and SD, the makeup choices are girl or boy. For SDGrB and SD16, the makeup options are natural or vivid. You also can choose to order blank, but you will not receive Zoukeimura eyes with your doll. "Revival" signifies that the makeup has been changed since the last offering.</p>
