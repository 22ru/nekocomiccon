    <h1>Recast Identification</h1>
	<p>I truly believe hiding this information is detrimental to the BJD hobby. I understand why DoA bans it, because recast discussion destroys all enjoyment of BJDs. This page is not a discussion, but information you may want when checking dolls you have purchased from indirect sources.</p>

    <p>All photos are of recasts unless otherwise noted. Many photos have been saved from secondhand recast listings on ebay. Right click to view image in new tab for full resolution. If any of these images are yours and you want them removed, DMCA me.</p>

    <h2>General information</h2>

    <p>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pbhXd51y28hTfqewgfSVs60oJEZ7EKZWb6vOt72p7tU/htmlview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recast master list</a> exists and is updated by recast supporters. It may not be completely accurate to all listings across all sites. If the doll you are looking for is not on this list, hopefully a recast version doesn't exist and you can rest more easily. Not all BJD companies are targeted equally.</p>

    <p>The major BJD recasters are Oueneifs/ChinaBJD/Luo, BJDPifa, HeheBJD, BJD Baby. If you see ANY markings on the doll with the name of a recaster, the doll is a recast.</p>

    <p>A few recasters have recreated CoAs for Soom The Gem and Fairyland dolls. Many recasters send their own CoA that does not resemble the original.</p>

    <p>A few doll boxes have been recreated, but most recasters send dolls in a box of their own design with the original company's name on it. The packaging almost never includes fabric pillows. Blister packaging is common now. I have never seen a legitimate resin company use blister packaging (Azone does for their dolls). In the past, the doll wrapped in bubble wrap and shoved in an unmarked box was the norm.</p>

    <p>Many companies only produce dolls in specific resin colors. If the doll was never released in the color, that is a very bad sign. This is useful for Volks dolls, because many limited dolls were never released in certain colors.</p>

    <p>Details are often lost in casting. Look for imperfect fingers, messy text. Stringing channels may not be carved cleanly.</p>

    <p>If you have the original doll to compare with, look for</p>
    <ul>
        <li>lighter weight resin</li>
        <li>shrinkage</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are plenty of recast box opening videos on youtube which will give you an idea of what to look out for in packaging.</p>

    <h2>Kinoko Juice</h2>

    <p>Kiki and Jill both have "キノコジュース" mark on their right butt cheek. Recasters often have trouble replicating the sharp corners of the text.</p>

    <h2>Fairyland</h2>

    <h2>Volks</h2>

    <p>Some recasters have recreated headplates. Others either leave the spot empty, fill it in, or add their own headplate.</p>
