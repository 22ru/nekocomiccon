    <p>I'm not sure everyone can say they bought a Volks doll on sale directly from VolksUSA, but I can! I bought her body during the LA showroom closing sale.</p>

	<p>I met and talked to Subaru for a while when she had $15 faceup commissions so I had her paint me a 06 head. Her red eyes were even made by Subaru herself! She gave them to me at AX 2017 ;u; Thank you!</p>

    <p>I love that I can leave her out without worrying about yellowing resin. Her most recently purchased hands match her fine despite her not being in a box the entire time I've had her.</p>

    <p>Option parts: DDII-H-04B, DDII-H-08B, DDII-H-09B</p>

	<h3>my "Opinion"</h3>
	<p class="date">07/17/2023</p>
	<p>Honestly I just put her in the detolf and forget about her. She's very pretty but there's no character or interactions driving me to play with her. I once said I would only buy DD from then on, and that is Not Happening. I don't think I'll buy another DD.</p>
	
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>She's not particularly good for hugging. I'm terrified of staining her. The fist hands the body arrived with are terribly boring.</p>
	
	<h3>History</h3>
    <p>I ordered her body, an S bust, and a pair of eyes from VolksUSA on 3/22/2014 for $304.16. I paid $52.50 on her head.</p>

    <p>I got a friend to buy me her SS bust at VolksUSA's Anime Expo booth one year.</p>
