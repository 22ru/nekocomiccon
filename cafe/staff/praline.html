    <p>I said I wouldn't buy another doll and I did anyway. Forgive me. A deal on ebay was all it took to break me. I spent far too long freaking out worrying about the possibility of her being a recast. Kame has been very kind to calm me (twice). I seriously need to stop buying secondhand dolls because I cannot handle this!</p>

	<p>Ryan said something about John Johnson Praline when talking about a Dostoevsky character right after I got her. So Ryan named her after a Dostoevsky character?? I could be pronouncing Praline wrong, so I hope you can read the katakana. With the help of hors, I picked out a kirakira/DQN name for her.</p>

	<p>I have white skin dolls, but this girl is WHITE. Paper white. I personally consider this a fantasy tone. I'm not sure if I would have chosen this had I ordered from Kame, but I'm working with it and having fun.</p>

	<p>Her blue/yellow eyes were made by me and were heavily inspired by Slyphynford Tachibana from Himouto Umaruchan, a show I can't stand. She has a pair of lavender kinoko eye that were a gift from <a href="https://zucchini.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hors</a> ♡.</p>
	
	<p>Her faceup is blue because I realized I had no brown gouache before painting her. Her next one probably won't be blue.</p>

	<h3>my "Opinion"</h3>
	<p class="date">07/17/2023</p>
	<p>I love all the personality I was able to pour into her! Kiki is so stylized doesn't necessarily feel like a child, which makes me more interested in playing with her. Unfortunately, her body is even tinier than other tinies!! I'll get over handsewing maybe someday...</p>
	
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>Her previous owner lost her kinoko eye. I can never understand how that would happen. Normal eyes do not fit in this head. Eyes must be chip style.</p>

    <p>She can't sit at all. Her knees pop forward sometimes and it's kind of annoying, but a good restringing might fix that.</p>
	
	<h3>History</h3>
    <p>I found a listing for a "Kikipop" on eBay that just so happened to be a resin Kiki. I paid $312.91 on 8/3/2022. Her previous owner said she was purchased from KJ's Etsy in December 2021. Despite this, her doll data card says "2020.5.12".</p>
