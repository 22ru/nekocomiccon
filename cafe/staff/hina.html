    <p>Apologies to Sochi, Hina is my favorite doll and my dream come true.</p>

	<p>I don't like to use the term "grail", but Lieselotte is as close as I'd get to one. I first saw her 2nd release in 2013 and fell in love. I entered her lottery despite not having any good way to come up with $1k at the time. I did not win her and I could not buy one for secondhand prices. I watched as she had more lotteries, but I knew there was no way for me to pay for her if I had one, so I did not enter.</p>

	<p>I kept Lieselotte in my heart for all those years. I had no expectations of ever getting one due to my bad lottery luck and extremely high aftermarket prices. In 2021, somehow the stars all aligned! Lieselotte was released as a preorder, not a lottery, and I had a job so that I could afford her. I also happened to get all of my stimulus checks right before her preorder opened. I had sworn that if any of those checks ever showed up, I would buy myself a doll! I didn't expect that doll to be the one I've been wishing for for years.</p>

	<p>I entered two lotteries while waiting for her. I won neither and I was sad Mother SD wouldn't bless me with a doll. I was so wrong! Hina was my blessing from Mother SD after all. She could not be more perfect and I want to cry of happiness every time I think about her. She is very precious to me and the most beautiful girl in the world.</p>

	<p>Hina has green/brown eyes to match minion Bob! Bob is so cute.... ;_____; They are Volks HG Green or Cadet Blue paired with Tea Rose with Black Line in 18mm.</p>

    <p>Option parts: SD-H-01, SD-H-04, SD-H-05, SD-H-11, SD-H-17, SD-H-18, SD-FO-00, SD-FO-03</p>

	<h3>my "Opinion"</h3>
	<p class="date">07/17/2023</p>
	<p>She is undeniably my favorite doll and most treasured possession. She felt like my reward for my struggle through my (extended) time in college. It felt like something good had finally happened to me after many years and that has made her more precious to me than she would have been under different circumstances.</p>
	
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>She has a defect spot on the back of her neck where it's lighter. I chose not to complain because it is so minor and almost never seen. Her faceup isn't as nice as the Ciera painted promo photos. The line under her teeth is jagged.</p>

    <p>I don't like the look of her double jointed elbows, but I get frustrated with my dolls who don't have double jointed elbows now. I take it back.</p>
	
	<h3>History</h3>
    <p>I ordered her from VolksUSA on 04/19/2021 for $950 + $35 shipping. She is a fullset.</p>
