	<p>I was a little too obsessed with Sacha Baron-Cohen at the time of BrÃ¼no because I originally named him "Sasha". He's now taking on the name of a Russian mathematician with an extremely fun name. Or just Cheby for short.</p>
	
	<p>I chose him because I liked Migidoll and there was one available on the DoA marketplace. I truly love Migidoll Ryu the most, but I thought Miho would be just as good. He is my lesson in "don't settle" because I bought a Ryu anyway. It took me over 13 years to get this boy a body and I felt nothing for him until I did. I am an irresponsible doll owner and I will never buy a floating head again. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.</p>

	<p>He was my cheapest large doll at a total of about $285 after shipping. So affordable, the deals I make with a DoA marketplace!</p>

	<p>He has SD13B-H-01 and SD13B-FO-01 (regular feet).</p>
	
	<p>Cheby is an incel and very grumpy. But I still give him many kisses ðŸ˜š</p>

	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>His first owner (afaik) was Fayth. I paid $150 + ~$10 in shipping. He may have been purchased through a group order with his faceup artist Meeve in 2007. His body was purchased from nikittin for $115.10 after shipping on 9/22/2022. The body was from Tsukasa Konoe (December 2003) purchased from Mandarake in 2016.</p>

	<p>He has nothing resembling a box.</p>
