	<p>I was a little too obsessed with Sacha Baron-Cohen at the time of BrÃ¼no because I originally named him "Sasha". He's now taking on the name of a Russian mathematician with an extremely fun name. Or just Cheby for short. How do you pronounce it? I have no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO_4-VhTBPo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idea</a>. Don't ask me.</p>
	
	<p>I chose him because I liked Migidoll and there was one available on the DoA marketplace. I truly love Migidoll Ryu the most, but I thought Miho would be just as good. He is my lesson in "don't settle" because I bought a Ryu anyway. It took me over 13 years to get this boy a body and I felt nothing for him until I did. I am an irresponsible doll owner and I will never buy a floating head again. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.</p>

	<p>He was my cheapest large doll at a total of about $285 after shipping. So affordable, the deals I make with a DoA marketplace!</p>

	<p>Cheby is an incel and very grumpy. But I still give him many kisses ðŸ˜š</p>

	<p>He has SD13B-H-01 and SD13B-FO-01 (regular feet).</p>

	<h3>my "Opinion"</h3>
	<p class="date">07/17/2023</p>
	<p>I tried to sell the head at least once after obtaining Ryu. I set him away in a box of doll supplies in my mom's house for multiple years. The most I did with the head was put it on my DDS body for a 4chan shitpost. It may or may not be known that I was willing to give Cheby's head away to the first 15 year old who told me her grail was Migidoll Miho.</p>

	<p>A very cheap price for a body was what finally convinced me to complete him. It took maybe a month before I was in love with Cheby. He is in my top 3 most played with dolls now. I adore his little angry face and just want to bully him. He has such a different expression from my other dolls who are some degree of smiling and it really sets him apart.</p>

	<p>I'm impressed with him having the high score for most falls of all my dolls! #untrustable</p>

	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>His first owner (afaik) was Fayth. I paid $150 + ~$10 in shipping. He may have been purchased through a group order with his faceup artist Meeve in 2007. His body was purchased from nikittin for $115.10 after shipping on 9/22/2022. The body was from Tsukasa Konoe (December 2003) purchased from Mandarake in 2016.</p>

	<p>He has nothing resembling a box.</p>

	<p>His faceup before September 2023 was done by Meeve in 2008.</p>
