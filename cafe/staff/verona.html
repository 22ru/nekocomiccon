	<p>Verona is baby face 1/3 boy! So cute! He's named after the location of Romeo and Juliet. If I use the name "V", I'm talking about this boy. You'll often see him with Liam.</p>

    <p>I'm not very happy with his current look. I think he is my doll in most need of a faceup upgrade. He still has the feel of the early Korean BJD.</p>

    <p>His resin is slightly translucent and has really sold me on French resin despite the yellowing issues. I don't purposely seek out tan dolls anymore, but I also think he's too light to be considered truly tan! He just looks tan next to my NS and WS dolls. The French resin mix gives him a slight glow my others dont have.</p>
	
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>The Iplehouse oYID body really isn't the best. His fingers are sausagey and he's strangely muscular. I want him to be shorter than Liam, but at 65cm, there's not a ton of bodies taller than him that aren't 70cm.</p>

    <p>I love the translucency of his resin, but I won't be able to hybrid him to a nicer or smaller body because of it. I regret that a little.</p>
	
	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>I am the first owner of Verona. I ordered him on 11/28/2009. I believe his price was around $650, but I can't find any record of it. He came with a CoA with my name on it!</p>

    <p>He doesn't have an offical box, but instead a very awesome carrier bag. I took the stuffing out of the pillows and replaced the outsides with white cotton to prevent staining if my DD were to go in the bag. His box for many years was a pink Aeyork one that he shares with Liam.</p>
