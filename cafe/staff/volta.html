	<p>I rigged the lottery. He looks a little like <a href="https://zucchini.cc/dolls/collection#sascha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sascha</a> doesn't he? They're related by blood.</p>

	<p>His real name was taken from a very important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researcher</a>. His pseudonym "Volta" is Italian for "time". It was chosen because it sounds cool and chuunibyou and all. No meaning was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intended</a>.</p>

	<p>Option parts: SD13B-H-01*2,  SD13B-H-07,  SD13B-H-08,  SD13B-H-10,  SD13B-H-12, SDGrB-FO-01, SDGrB-FO-02</p>
