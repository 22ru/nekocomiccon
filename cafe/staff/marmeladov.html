    <p>What a looker amirite? I didn't mean it when I said no more tan dolls because this boy is perfect. He can steal hearts with those eyes! He definitely took mine.</p>

	<p>I was lucky enough to win this boy in the VolksUSA lottery after losing him in Volks Int! I prayed to Mother SD every night and used up my next 5 years of lottery wins with her. He was worth it and would do it again in a heartbeat! I love this boy!</p>

	<p>Ryan named him after a character in a Dostoevsky novel. Where did Dostoevsky get all these great names?</p>
	
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>He's married ;A;</p>
	
	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>Marmeladov is my cheapest doll at $0! Just because he's the cheapest doesn't make him any less good. He was purchased from VolksUSA as a fullset.</p>
