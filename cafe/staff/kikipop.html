    <p>I discovered Kiki in 2011. KJ lovers know that prior to KJ opening their Etsy store, a Kiki would set you back at least $1000 USD, if you were lucky enough to find one. You can imagine everyone's shock when Azone's HELLO KIKIPOP! was announced. I wasn't able to afford the first release at the time, but more releases came.</p>

    <p>I asked my mother for Kikipop 2nd for my combined birthday and Christmas gift in 2015 and surprisingly, she agreed. I had trouble deciding between Caramel Brown and Milky Blonde because my ideal is pink and blonde. I chose Carmel Brown and I'm glad I did, because I wasn't impressed with the wig quality and replaced it anyway.</p>

	<p>She was one of the two dolls I kept while living in a college dorm. I can't recommend bringing your dolls to college though!</p>

	<h3>my "Opinion"</h3>
	<p class="date">07/17/2023</p>
	<p>I like that she can just chill out in the sunlight but I haven't touched her much since getting Praline. I would never have gotten her if I had known it would be possible for me to own a resin Kiki in my lifetime.</p>
	
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>One of her hands came with yellow discoloration. It's not super obvious, but HobbySearch would only give me 1000 yen in credit for it. I would much rather have just had a good hand!</p>

    <p>The Kikipop body is very stiff. She can stand very well, but there is no floppiness of a BJD other than in her neck which will flop.</p>

    <p>Her hand pegs have become loose over the years. Her hands no longer stay on well. It's my opinion that the joint in the neck is very unattractive.</p>

    <p>The clothes that came with her were well made, but her wig feels incredibly cheap. The wigs I have on her are almost never the default.</p>
	
	<h3>History</h3>
    <p>She was ordered from Hobby Search on December 8, 2015. She cost $240.35 USD/28,800 JPY after shipping.</p>
