		<p>Guess who looked at hiritai's Hayden too long? This girl. I had to get my own. I REALLY wanted one but I was so intimidated about ordering a doll from someone who did not share a language with me over email. I finally got one secondhand after a while, after buying a Miho who I didn't like nearly as much as Ryu.</p>

		<p>Liam's first name comes from 夢見りあむ. His last name was stolen from a certain Brandon Lee movie. I was just a little obsessed at the time.</p>

		<p>Liam is my favorite boy doll. His handsome face just steals my heart every time I look at him! At the right angle, he makes the face every girl wants to be looked at with.</p>
		
		<p>Once at a Japanese garden meetup in Spokane, a man complimented him and said he was a pretty girl. I quietly said thank you and my friend was like "no he's a boy!! look!!!" and flashed the poor man. Dude, I'm so sorry you had to see that...</p>

		<p>He has SD13B-H-03 and SD13B-FO-02 (tabi feet).</p>

	<h3>my "Opinion"</h3>
	<p class="date">07/17/2023</p>
	<p>He's my favorite boy. His face is perfection! I stare at him a lot. His hands are a little weird but that's my biggest complaint. I've been fighting to get him in a wig I like, and he looked good in the alternate wig I bought for Verona! I never got used to the brown fiber one.</p>

	<p>I tried to give him to Hina, but it didn't work. I still can't get over that Verona is taller than him after I got him the SD13B body. I'll get used to it right?</p>

	<p>I would love to own a second head for him to realize my original vision of him while keeping his current face intact. He really doesn't look much like my drawings of him as a teen!</p>
	
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
		<p>The seller, Circe-Nausicca, neglected to mention in his listing that his face is modded. I found this out in 2021 when combing through her dA trying to figure out his resin tone. Circe also claimed he has had only once faceup but has photos of him with a different faceup. Do your research before transactions, kids.</p>

		<p>I know nothing about this doll. I've emailed Migidoll to ask about his resin tone and she said she only had record of Circe-Nausicca ordering a NS Ryu from her. I feel like conspiracy meme dude every time I look up any history on his head.</p>

		<p>This is the early version of the Ryu head, meaning the headcap is not particularly secure.</p>

		<p>I don't love the IH oYID body. The thighs are those of a bicycle fanatic and his fingers resemble sausages.</p>

		<p>The neck is a little too thick and offers limited motion, but the resin match is close. I made a leather disc to act as KIPS for now. </p>

	<h3>Body match and change</h3>

	<p>When I bought Liam, I wasn't so picky about bodies. He came on an oYID model body, which is fine, but not quite my ideal. The body is really ripped and feels a little stiffer than my preference. I've also become super picky about hands and I just do not like the oYID hands.</p>

	<p>When I bought him, the seller didn't list his resin tone past white skin. At the time, I wasn't bothered because he already had a body so I didn't have to live through the pain of making a hybrid. My discontentment with my favorite boy's body grew and grew. About 1.5 years ago, I started considering replacing his body.</p>

	<p>I started off by looking into what his resin tone actually was based off the user's posts around the time she got him. I just got more confused and frustrated the more I read, but got the feeling he was Volks matching. I did find out his face had undisclosed mods.</p>

	<p>His hands were my main complaint, so I considered buying a pair of wrist balls. My SD13B wrists/hands did mostly fit on the oYID body with a bit of gapping. I considered the number of people on Earth who would sell just a set of wrist balls from the correct time period and threw out that idea. It's definitely easier to find a new body.</p>

	<p>My requirement for the new body was that I needed him to be taller than Verona, my IH Louis. I wasn't smart when choosing Verona, because his resin is 100% unmatchable. Otherwise, I would have just put him on the regular legged SD13 body and this would have been simple. </p>

	<p>I looked into Volks bodies because I prefer them and it meant I would need to find a WS SD17 body for him to be taller. Volks fans I'm sure know that this is probably next to impossible to find an ~2009 WS SD17 body. Threw out that idea and tried to forget about the plan for a while. I eventually decided it would be fine if they continued to be matched in height. This opened up SD13B long leg and SDGrB as options! They are very slightly shorter. I had been vaguely watching Mandarake for a bit and cried at the thought of spending an extra $100 on shipping on a body that might not match.</p>

	<p>Vega offered to help me find a match, and confirmed my suspicions that Liam is Volks matching based off color difference between my other dolls. It was a ton of help and gave me a big confidence boost to actually drop the money on something!</p>
	
	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>I have no idea what owner I am of him. I bought him from Circe-Nausicca on DoA for $550 + shipping. She claimed to have bought him from Migidoll, but Migi does not corroborate that she purchased any WS heads. His oYID body is likely from a IH Louis split with Aernath in November 2009.</p>

	<p>I purchased an SD13B body from nikittin on DoA (again) on 2/17/2023. She was the second owner. The doll was from a F-17 Sato FCS order around 2006. I paid $156 + $21.40 shipping.</p>

    <p>He has a Souldoll box and a Souldoll Liddell CoA. The Souldoll pillows are yellow and WAY too short for the box. His box for many years was a pink Aeyork one that he shared with Verona.</p>
