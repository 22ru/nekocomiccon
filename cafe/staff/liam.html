	<p>Guess who looked at hiritai's Hayden too long? This girl. I had to get my own.</p>

    <p>Liam's first name is just one I liked while his last name was stolen from a certain Brandon Lee movie. I was just a little obsessed at the time.</p>

    <p>Liam is my favorite boy doll. His handsome face just steals my heart every time I look at him! At the right angle, he makes the face every girl wants to be looked at with. He spends a lot of time with both Verona and Hina.</p>

    <p>Once at a Japanese garden meetup in Spokane, a man complimented him and said he was a pretty girl. I quietly said thank you and my friend was like "no he's a boy!! look!!!" and flashed the poor man. Dude, I'm so sorry you had to see that...</p>
	
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>The seller, Circe-Nausicca, neglected to mention in his listing that his face is modded. I found this out in 2021 when combing through her dA trying to figure out his resin tone. Circe also claimed he has had only once faceup but has photos of him with a different faceup.</p>

    <p>I know nothing about this doll. I've emailed Migidoll to ask about his resin tone and she said she only had record of Circe-Nausicca ordering a NS Ryu from her. I feel like conspiracy meme dude every time I look up any history on his head. I think he is Type B WS, but I have no definitive proof.</p>

    <p>I don't love the IH oYID body. I am looking into hybriding him, but I need him to be at least as tall as he is now, if not taller. It's a challenge.</p>
	
	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>I have no idea what owner I am of him. I bought him from Circe-Nausicca on DoA for $550 + shipping. She claimed to have bought him from Migidoll. His body is likely from a IH Louis split with Aernath in November 2009.</p>

    <p>He has a Souldoll box and a Souldoll Liddell CoA.</p>
