	<p>Olivia was not the first doll I bought, but the first I recieved. Sophie belongs to my mother. Between me and my mom, we own 10% of this model limited to 20 worldwide. Their faceups are just slightly different with Olivia looking a little spicier than the softer Sophie.</p>

    <p>At my second doll meetup, I saw my new friend's tan Bambicrony Kumi. She was so cute that I went home and impulsively ordered my own tan Bambicrony girl exactly 8 days later!</p>

	<h3>my "Opinion"</h3>
	<p class="date">07/17/2023</p>
	<p>Olivia is my only doll that I do not have in my possession, if that says anything. Sometimes I'm a little tempted to just give her to my mom, but it's not like my mom will play with her.</p>
	
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>Their midfoot is really flat. Their footprint is approximately the same size as other Yo sized dolls, but they very rarely can share shoes with them.</p>

    <p>Overall, the body is much thinner than a yo sized doll so clothes often can't be shared. The head is also smaller.</p>
	
	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>I am the first owner of Olivia. She was ordered on 2/19/2009 from Bambicrony for $348.</p>

    <p>Sophie was bought from DoA user lookame for $200 + shipping.</p>

    <p>Both of them have a CoA, which is rare for BJDs in that time period! The paper used isn't consistent between them.</p>
