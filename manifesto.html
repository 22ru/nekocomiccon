<p>it's come to my attention that recently, many internet users do not know how to remain safe on the internet! early in my life there were many things that were common knowledge that have seem to be forgotten</p>

    <h3>hat's internet safety tips!</h3>
    <h4>1. never reveal your real name online!</h4>
    <p>fran hat is my real name but i'm very internet experienced so please do not follow my lead!</p>
    <p>social media normalized sharing this but that doesn't mean you should do it.</p>

    <h4>2. never post your face on the internet!</h4>
    <p>i am also guilty of this. don't look at my about page.</p>

    <h4>3. don't tell anyone where you live</h4>
    <p>posting pictures of your surroundings can reveal a lot about your location, even if you aren't in the photo</p>
    <p>even more foolish is to tell them when you're leaving on vacation. say goodbye to your nintendo switch, sucker!</p>

    <h4>4. don't believe anything you read on the internet</h4>
    <p>not even this!</p>

    <h4>5. if it's too good to be true, it's too good to be true.</h4>
    <p>i've met a nigerian prince and he was not real.</p>

    <h4>6. turn off the computer and go outside</h4>
    <p>this limitless information bombarding you constantly is destroying your mind</p>

    <h3>Advanced tips for awesome internetters</h3>
    <p>are you ready to take safety to the next level?</p>

    <h4>if someone is typing more than 1 word responses to you with no "omg randum" messages, they are not 13</h4>
    <p>lets face it: 13 year old are the most uninteresting people to talk to and cant carry a conversation. if the person you're speaking has more to say to you than "LMAO POTATO" they are lying about their age.</p>

    <h4>use a different username between all sites</h4>
    <p>yes i did just google your username and found your location and your real name.</p>

    <h4>if for some god forsaken reason you decide to meet up with your internet friend, bring a responsible adult with you to a public location</h4>
    <p>unless you want to be kidnapped, of course.</p>

    <h4>that cool adult guy you met online isn't attractive to anyone his own age</h4>
    <p>if he was, he wouldn't be talking to a kid.</p>

    <h4>don't use "pizza" as the answer to your password reset question</h4>
    <p>it's always pizza. y'all need to try some different foods.</p>

    <h4>don't post suicide or death threats online</h4>
    <p>jesus h christ.</p>

    <h4>no one needs to know your gender</h4>

    <h4>you dont owe anyone anything and you don't need to be polite</h4>
    <p>if you are under 18 and someone starts messaging you about anything sexual, block them. if they creep you out, block them.</p>

    <h4>just because it seems like everyone likes this person, doesnt mean anyone even knows them</h4>
    <p>"i didnt want to say anything because everyone was friends with them" is something I hear way too often. half the time its a dude who everyone knows of but no one knows</p>
