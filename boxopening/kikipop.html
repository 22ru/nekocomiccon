<h2>kikipop</h2>
<h4 class="date">December 18, 2015</h4>
<p>the day kikipops were announced was an amazing day! i couldnt believe kinokojuice was going to release kiki to the world for an extremely reasonable price! god bless!!!</p>

<p>i wasnt able to get the first kikipop, but my mom agreed to buy kikipop 2nd for me for my birthday and christmas present</p>

<p>one of her hands has a defect where theres a yellow smudge on her knuckle. hobby search could only offer me $10 of points for it, but i really just wanted a replacement hand! i had no intention of buying from them later anyway...</p>

<p>i think i'll try to skip kikipops from now on because her hands have horrible troubles staying on. her neck joint is a bit loose, but shes a solid stander. I make no promises on skipping kikipops though because azone makes some incredibly cute sets! i really would like a resin kiki though!</p>
