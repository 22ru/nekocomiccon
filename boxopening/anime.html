<h4 class="date">March 31, 2014</h4>

<p>volksusa showroom had a closing sale so i jumped on it and bought a DDS body</p>

<p>i was talking to subaru at the time and she was willing to do a faceup for me so i had her get a head for me. i think the head arrived right after ECCC that year because my room was covered in crap from that con</p>

<p>she is my first vinyl doll so i was shocked with how lightweight she is! she weighs about the same as an MSD</p>
