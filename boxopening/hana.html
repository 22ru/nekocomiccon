<h2>Bluefairy Hana</h2>
<h4 class="date">September 21, 2012</h4>
<p>i found a SF Hana girl on the marketplace for $150 and jumped on it</p>

<p>the owner messaged me back a bit later and told me the doll was actually on a boy body and she just didnt notice until now.</p>

<p>i asked her for a discount, since i didnt want the boy body as much. she offered me $50 off. i was ecstatic!</p>

<p>she sent him in the bluefairy box, which was destroyed by the postal service of course</p>

<p>the head in the pictures was traded with a good friend of mine for the same head, but with a faceup.</p>
