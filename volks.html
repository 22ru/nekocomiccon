<h2>hat's Mother SD Shrine</h2>

<p>Volks has almost completely dominated the Japanese resin doll market. You will rarely see Japanese owners with another brand of doll.</p>


<h3>Locations</h3>
    <p>There are so many Volks stores in Japan! They can be separated into 4 types.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tenshi no Sato 天使の里 "Angel's Village"</li>
        <p>Volks HQ in Kyoto. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKJGUXDB-bQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video tour by the creepiest host</a> for your viewing pleasure. Dollfie Dreams are not allowed after 2015. Tenshi models and many FCS models are exclusive to this store.</p>

        <li>Tenshi no Mado 天使の窓 "Angel's Window"</li>
        <p>Volks' Harajuku location. It's still a very pretty shop and has more FCS options than a Sumika.</p>

        <li>Tenshi no Sumika 天使のすみか "Angel's Volks Dollfie Shop"</li>
        <p>The rest of the Dollfie stores! There are multiples of these in many cities. They're much smaller than Sato and Mado, but still look fun!</p>

        <li>Doll Point ドールポイント</li>
        <p>Shortened to "Dolpo". There's one in Akihabara and one in Osaka. They are focused on Dollfie Dreams, but Super Dollfie is offered there as well. Offers an FCS-like service for Dollfie Dreams called Dream Choice.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>There's not much for international doll lovers, unfortunately.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>VolksUSA</li>
        <p>The LA Sumika was closed down in 2014, but the <a href="https://volksusastore.com/webstores/dollfie/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online business</a> remains open. My teenage dreams of visiting were crushed. Once in a while, they'll vend at a doll show or anime convention. They cannot sell outside of North America.</p>

        <li>Korea Sumika</li>
        <p>Closed down in 2017. Dolls can still be purchased through <a href="https://www.haruhanadoll.com/main/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haruhana</a>. Sometimes haruhana gets more interesting dolls than VolksUSA just sayin.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>And of course, the online shop, <a href="https://dollfie.ec.volks.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volks International</a>! </p>

<h3>Volks News</h3>
    <p>A quarterly magazine sold by Volks with information about new releases. Even if you can't buy the doll, you can buy the magazine so you can stare lovingly at the doll you lost in the lottery.</p>

<h3>Types of Super Dollfie</h3>
    <h4>Standard</h4>
    <p>Available all the time. Only a few models are offered at a time and the lineup changes every few years. For some reason, there haven't been any boys.</p>

    <p>In addition to standards, there's limited standards. SD WS Mai and SDGrB Haru are examples of these. I believe haruhana has had these once, but never VolksUSA. They're limited releases for events at Sato for the most part.</p>

    <h4>Coordinate</h4>
    <p>Dolls available to be purchased immediately in store. They come fully dressed and are wearing matching outfits. Super Dollfie Midi and Dear SD are the only dolls that show up as coordinate models.</p>

    <h4>Limited</h4>
    <p>Dolls released in limited numbers. They're usually sold by lottery or very rarely, pre-order. Some older releases did have publicized numbers, but we will probably never know the current numbers, except of a few dolls like Momoko Ryugasaki, Mana-sama, and HYDE, who all have numbered headplates. Volks likes to release dolls in storylines that are cute! </p>

    <h4>Full Choice System</h4>
    <p>Shortened to FCS (English) and フルチョ (Japanese). A method of buying a Volks doll where you can choose every aspect of your doll. Usually takes around 2 months to get your doll made. Limited doll heads are not offered, but there's 100-ish heads to choose from for an SD sized doll. VolksUSA offers a watered down version of this called OnlineFCS. More like "Some Choice System".</p>
    <p>This is the only way to get a doll in PS Everbeauty. These dolls have special headplates which are silver. They are promised to yellow as slowly as possible, but cost about twice the price of a PS Fair/White doll.</p>
    <p>Dream FCS (夢フルチョ) is like FCS on drugs and costs like $4k. Pick any doll in any resin color with any faceup just do whatever you want! They do not offer this very often or to more than a few people.</p>

    <h4>PS Bisque</h4>
    <p>To get one of these, you have to visit Tenshi no Sato to enter the lottery for one. If you win, you'll get a call from Tenshi no Sato, and you'll have to come in to pick it up after listening to a 1 hour spiel about them. There are four headmolds available: Kasumi and Yayoi and an almost closed eyed version of both. They are on the SDGr yumetenshi body. It's a genderless body based off the SDGr girl body. All of these are blushed, either point (partial) or full. The faceup and blushing are sealed in a way that cannot be removed or scratched. Allegedly, PS Bisque yellows faster than PS Everbeauty.</p>
    <p>If you get caught buying or selling one of these secondhand, Volks will ban you. To get rid of one, you must return the doll to Volks.</p>

    <h4>One-Off</h4>
    <p>A doll with a faceup done by a Volks artist that is one of a kind. The base doll is not OOAK, but the outfit may be. Volks will often commission popular dealers from their Dolpa events for the outfits. These are usually sold by lottery in person at a Volks store or event. Once in a blue moon, they will also be sold by lottery online. VolksUSA and Haruhana get these about once a year.</p>

    <p>The winners of one-offs from Volks stores are notified with a white envelope containing a photo and information of the doll. </p>

    <p>Included in this are Super Dollfie Dream, which are Dollfie Dream cast in resin. Extremely rare as only a few have been released many years ago. <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/teaoevo/archives/1705676.html#%E3%83%89%E3%83%AB%E3%83%9126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I swear I'm not crazy.</a></p>

    <h4>Charity Auction</h4>
    <p>I hope you have too much money if you want one of these. Sold at events only.</p>

<h3>Dolls Party ドールズ パーティー</h3>
    <p>Shortened to ドルパ Dolpa. Quarterly in person Volks event where new dolls are released and dealers gather to sell goods. Many happen at Tokyo Big Sight, but this isn't the only location. Hometown Dolpa take place in Kyoto. VolksUSA also hosts a Dolpa in LA once every 2 years or so since 2015.</p>

    <p>There have been a few events on cruise ships. You'll find some Oath of Silver Coin dolls were exclusive to these events.</p>

    <p>Volks used to hold some events at the Volks Mansion. There's no way Volks owns a mansion in California. I have no idea what this was about. Only used for events and parties in the 2000's.</p>

    <p>At Dolpa 30 in 2013, Volks broke the world record of the longest line of dolls. Nakayoshi hand parts were given to participants.</p>

<h3>"oddities"</h3>
    <h4>Tenshi</h4>
    <p>There's a few very special models which are small sculpted angels that are given away at Volks events. These models cannot be purchased from Volks. For Yo/MSD/SDM/SD, it just means the body has no genitals. Both male and female SD bodies are converted to tenshi bodies and although the girls are completely flat, you can tell which base body was used easily by the overall body shape.</p>

    <h4>Omukae お迎え Welcoming Ceremony</h4>
    <p>Volks ceremony performed in a Volks location where you welcome your new doll into your life. A free service.</p>

    <h4>Wakare service 別れサービス Farewell service</h4>
    <p>My little American brain can't process this one. You can choose to send back your doll to Volks. You pay 2000 yen to Volks. Volks refurbishes the doll and then sells it in their store. You recieve a little crystal heart in return. Here's a <a href="https://plants--maiden-pink.translate.goog/?p=3579&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> (<a href="https://travel-dolls.blog.jp/archives/11400870.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and another</a>) from someone crazy enough to use this service.</p>

    <h4>Mother SD</h4>
    <p>She is the great and holy spirit behind Super Dollfie! She decides if you win the Volks lottery for the doll you love. She can be seen at Tenshi no Sato.</p>
