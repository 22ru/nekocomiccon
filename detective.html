<h2>Detective Pikachu</h2>

<p>he is so cute! he is my favorite! i love him!</p>

<p>his little hat! his fuzzy cheeks! his coffee breath!</p>

<p>no pokemon can be more perfect than this lil guy</p>

<p>the hearts in my eyes appeared when the movie was first leaked on youtube</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAA_yWX8ycQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">please watch!</a></p>

<p>i have never seen such a cute yellow blob before. watch the whole thing.</p>

<p>i convinced my loving mother to take me to see it on mother's day in theaters! they didn't have the promo cards though. i was very sad</p>

<p>my imouto's friend saw it at a different theater that did have cards and she gave me hers ;A; thank u!!</p>

<p>every day every night i cannot stop thinking of detective pikachu</p>

<p>the tcg promo cards were in stores! i needed them! i bought a few packs!</p>

<p>i found out target had life size plushies! unfortunately there is no target near me</p>

<p>i sent imouto out on an important mission to procure a life size detecive. she came back with a build a bear pikachu instead</p>

<p>this mission was beyond her ability, so i had to take it into my own hands. i made her drive me to target (1 hour away from my moms house) and i grabbed the beautiful detective and tucked him safely into my arms! i was wandering through walmart as usual and found a detective shirt in the boys section. my mom reluctantly bought it for me</p>

<p>i arrived home from my mommy's house and ryan gave me a whole lunch box tin with my little detective on it</p>

<p>i am in love!!!</p>

<p>finally the day arrived, august 6th, 2019, the day detective pikachu came out on bluray! ryan sneakily bought it for me</p>

<p>i watched it twice that day! i was so happy~ i gave him the detecive card inside because we were only able to get one of the theater cards</p>

<p>please come over and watch it with me! it is my favorite movie</p>

<p>a few months later i was wandering through walmart (as usual) with ryan and found 3 little detecives on clearance. they were above my NEET budget so i left them, but ryan grabbed one anyway and bought it for me! </p>
