	<p>I've been sitting on these photos for a few days. I'm sorry for not posting them sooner!</p>

	<p>The squirrel feeder is the MOST FUN EVER1!!!!! I'm gonna have one of these in my yard someday. My tree rodents will be MASSIVE.</p>

	<p>Our most common visitor was the gray squirrel. He's pretty cute! He likes to eat upside down.</p>

	<p>Our next visitor is the Douglas squirrel. He's small and feisty! He chases off gray squirrels and birds that approach his feeder. He let me get closest for photos.</p>

	<p>Our unexpected visitor is the chipmunk! He's pretty timid, but he can hide under the leaves from the Douglas squirrel and sneak a bite from the ground.</p>
