	<p>I survived playing another otome game. While I liked Bustafellows much more than Code:realize, I'm not particularly impressed with the genre so far. Perhaps they should just be rated in comparision to your average anime plot. Bustafellows would be pretty d&ng good in that case!</p>

	<p>For a week, I've returned to my old town! No one has taken my old apartment, but someone has been so kind to let us stay at their house a block away from my old apartment. I miss my old place! I don't have nearly as much space anymore. I don't miss the job paying my rent there though.</p>

	<p>My favorite part about being here is going to my favorite thrift stores! I haven't found a location that matches the quality and prices of the two I love here. There haven't been any recent Cool Thrift Hauls lately because the other stores all suck!!!!</p>
