    <p>It feels like it's been forever since I wrote a blog post!! It really hasn't been very long, but the advent calendar took up a lot of my time and ideas. I have a lot to write about but I wanted to share that I knocked off another 2023 BJD goal at the last moment!!! WE DID IT!!!!!</p>

	<p>I met up with my bestie and we had a doll meetup!! It got too late to go to a real cafe, so we had our meetup at Starbucks.</p>

	<p>I finally met our infamous Dollshe boy!! He's here and wearing cats on his hoodie.</p>

	<p>He's got a neck joint and shoulder joints. I'm pretty sure his shoulder joints were on the wrong side so I can't comment on the functionality of them. His color "copper oriental" is nice! It's a very pleasant natural slightly tan.</p>
