    <p>I went to Arizona!!! One might ask, what exactly is in Arizona? I have an answer for you!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Lizards</li>
        <li>Cactus</li>
        <li>Houses</li>
        <li>Grocery stores</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I was amazed at the sheer number of houses down there. The city was very flat and wide. Not a single house had a lawn and everything was dirt and rocks. Also there was like no shopping?! I did find a selection of Texas Pete on the shelf at Safeway, but I couldn't bring it home without a checked bag ;a; I saw two Goodwills on the way back to the airport, but it was too late to visit them.</p>
