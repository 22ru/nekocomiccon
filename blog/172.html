    <p>I'm sure anyone who cares already knows, but I wiped Cheby and redid his faceup myself. Here you go! Here's his new face. Not really so different from the last one.</p>

    <img src="../cafe/img/gallery/cheby/LOL06058.jpg">

    <p>I spent days trying to get my lines thin enough, the eyelashes at the right angle, and the eyebrows placed okay. Turns out his eyebrows are the most important part of him and should not be changed too much!</p>

    <p>I did a faceup before the one shown and it was just so NOT Cheby. He looked all wrong!! I was very upset and wiped it before finishing it.</p>

    <p>I finally got to go to some yard sales this year with my mom. I totally scored. I'm really happy!!</p>


    <p>The camera bag was marked $20, but they took $15 for it. It came with a body case for the T50 which appears to have mold? My mom said she'd work on scrubbing the mold off the plastic but I'm not against tossing it. I at least got it in a baggie.</p>

    <p>My camera is a whopping 10.5 inches long with the 75-200mm lens fully extended. This is ridiculous!! Even not extended, it attracts too much attention and people start asking me questions! Stop!!! Let me shoot pictures of rocks in peace! I'm not famous!!</p>

    <p>Another cool find was this GBA. The price was $10, but I tried to talk her down to $5 because someone had ripped off the start and select buttons and the battery cover clip was broken off. She was very reluctant to drop the price because it was worth $100 on eBay! Wow!! She eventually offered 8 and I got her to 7. I tested it when I got home and it does turn on. I'm giving it to Ryan for his modding escapades.</p>
