	<p>First post of the year~ I'm way behind again! I was enjoying non daily posting too much. Who knew being a neet would be so busy...</p>

	<p>My first box opening is a gift from <a href="https://zucchini.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hors</a>~</p>

	<p>One more gift arrived that day from Linus! It's my favorite Kpop band, The Trax! They're very cool and you have to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqnscuWhDic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paradox</a>.</p>

    <p>I've been thinking a lot about air fryers lately. Everyone I know has one. They all love them and can't stop talking about them! So I decided to use my neet bux and order a Ninja CRISPi Air Fryer off <a href="https://oldoldcool.cool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oldoldcool.cool</a>.</p>

    <p>My air fryer came quickly using Amazon Prime 2 day  shipping. Cheby was also excited to test this bad boy out! Air fried broccoli ahoy!!!</p>

    <p>Look at how much packing they used! This is a very safe air fryer!</p>

	<p>A photo of the Goods and included accessories. Can't wait to take this baby for a ride.</p>

    <p>I would definitely recommend <a href="https://oldoldcool.cool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oldoldcool.cool</a> over Amazon. The price was better than Amazon, the service was incredible, and the shipping was fast! I just canceled my Amazon Prime+ subscription!</p>
