    <p>I finally made it through the last case of Ace Attorney. I started looking through art and stuff again and I can't wait for my boys Maximillion Galactica and Klavier Gavin. I haven't seen them in so long!!</p>

    <p>Ryan bought me Pokemon Crystal a bit ago and he wanted to play it with me! I already caught a useless Hoppip! But I realized I did not download Pokemon Bank before the end of the eShop and I am sad now.</p>

    <p>I got an email from <a href="https://strawberryreverie.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arachne</a> the other night with a beautiful drawing of my Hina! ;_______; so blessed please look</p>

    <p>Ryan and I took a lovely walk today! It sprinkled a bit but it was nice. I found a copy of Vampire Knight 1, but it was $5.50 and looked like it had been dipped in something. I've been trying to get reviews on that series but not many people have seen it!</p>

        <li>Bridgman's Life Drawing $.55</li>

        <li>Classic Pooh cookie mold $.99</li>
        <p>I can't really eat cookies so I don't know why I bought this other than very cute</p>
    </ul>

    <p>Two new microblogs appeared using my script ;u; I am so happy! I've been looking into issues with newsboat though and I'm kind of annoyed it can only parse one date format and not all 3 RFC822 timezone options. </p>

    <p>U149 started!!! I'm so happy!! My favorite Nina got episode 2 and she is so cute ;AAAA; Gimme more anime about little girls doing cute things. PLUS the producer is super cute!!!! I was about to say this is the Best Anime of the 2020s, but Kakushigoto still takes the cake for me.</p>

    <p>The other day, for the THIRD time, my SSD unmounted itself. PLEASE remind me to back up my drive and also buy another one.... seriously keep bugging me until I do it!!</p>
