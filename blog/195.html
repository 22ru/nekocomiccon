	<p>The sewing bug hit me again...</p>

	<p>First up: a vest! My apologies to hors. It ties in the back to allow for shirtless wearing or shirted wearing. It's lined in white cotton because I am running incredibly low on this fabric. I was smart enough to check the stretch on this bad boy.</p>

	<p>Next up was a blouse for under the vest. I tried patterning something and wasn't happy and I don't think I have enough white fabric. Inspiration lost...</p>

	<p>BUT THEN! I saw the fabric that hors had sent me for Christmas! I had an idea to make it a striped box pleated skirt when I first saw it. I cut into it without a lot of planning. I started folding box pleats, but it was obvious I didn't have enough. I tried again with knife pleats. I was so dangerously close to not having enough. Hina is holding LITERALLY all that remains of the fabric. </p>

	<p>Geometric prints are really fun. Why do American stores mostly only have tacky tasteless prints?</p>

	<p>Next was a pair of pants for Cheby. They're the same pattern as his old pants, but I had sewn .5cm seam allowance after drawing 1cm. I scrambled at the end and the pants worked, but weren't quite what I had set out to make. I had even ignored the stretch direction so the back of the pants have horizontal stretch while the front has vertical.</p>

	<p>Attempt 2 involved patchworking enough fabric together. It's 2 way stretch, so I had to match the stretch and I was nearly out of it 2 projects ago. It was just the scraps from someone's pants but it worked well for making little doll clothes. I got a lot out of it.</p>

	<p>I gotta force myself to throw away the scraps so I don't try to start another painfully close project. You know I will again...</p>

	<p><a href="https://strawberryreverie.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arachne</a> linked me <a href="https://pepperell.com/projects/stretch-magic-projects/stretch-magic-tattoo-choker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instructions</a> on how to make tattoo chokers the other night so I went a little wild and made a few out of thread. They aren't very hard to make!</p>

	<p>Today is the 25th anniverary of Super Dollfie! I hope you all celebrated~ I took some photos of Hina with Shirokuma Setsu-chan for the occasion. She's so cute today ♥</p>
