	<p>Cute!!! My mom says "Easter?" every time I send her a picture of him. She also thinks Grassy is a girl, but I'm not choosing to fight that battle.</p>

	<p>I haven't wanted to play games since the TV broke. BOTW2 is definitely one that feels better to play on the TV. We've been using the smaller TV as backup, but it's not the same. I've decided to put BOTW2 to the side and instead play Ace Attorney 2. I haven't played this one since I was around 14.</p>

	<p>I was REALLY enjoying Black Butler until around volume 25, when a big old twist was added. I don't mind twists like that when they are planned from the beginning, but I don't feel like there was any hint of this twist more than 5 volumes earlier. It bummed me out so much!!! You can't pull that off unless it's in your head from volume 1!</p>

	<p>I've now read every volume in the library (31) and am almost fully caught up. Toboso-sensei really cut down on jokes since the idol arc. Bring back the jokes please...</p>

	<p>I've been having a bit of an issue with using my joycon as a remote. The dang thing only charges on the switch you see, but it is a pain in the b*tt to get this thing to pair again with my computer after it pairs with the switch!</p>

	<p>Connecting via bluetoothctl with the MAC address seems to solve the issue. I haven't been able to get it to connect with the GUI.</p>
