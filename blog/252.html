	<p>I took a couple more shots of the <a href="https://www.acbjd.com/wms033-black-13-p-17618.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Msire wig</a> I bought a few months ago for Volta and just recently straightened. One of the wefts isn't secured as well on the front of the wig as one would hope. I might have to take some thread to it.</p>

	<p>I didn't like how the photos of Hina and Volta turned out, so I came back a few days later after attempting to style the Leeke wig a second time. It was also a little bit earlier in the day so the window was more generous with the Sun's pattern.</p>

	<p>Both of these wigs are not cut, just ironed and gelled. I'm not very good at this wig styling business so I'm trying not to butcher them yet. It'd be nice to see both of Volta's eyes sometime, huh...</p>

	<p>Here's Hina with her new Starbucks tumbler that I see I haven't posted the haul for yet. Oops. It's coming soon to a nekocomiccon near you!!</p>
