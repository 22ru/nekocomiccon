    <p>i decided i'm going to enter volksUSA's lottery for dear sd mai. i dont think you can stop me now unless you enter yourself and drop my chances of winning. it'll be okay if I dont get her, but if I do, I think I will name her Saori unless ryan convinces me Sayuri is better.</p>

    <p>i like the name sayuri too but i cant have a saori and a sayuri theyre just too close!!</p>

    <p>im also like 90% decided on lieselotte's name! I'll call her hina. I think it's a cute name that fits her sweet face. I'm past the 4 month wait mark now! I'm still as excited as the day i ordered her even if im shaking a lot less.</p>
    
    <p>I hope volksusa does the special owner items order too because I do want some FCS hands.. I still havent decided which ones I need though. I thought i wanted sd-h-12 but they're the only ones not on the order list! foiled again. are the peace sign ones too goofy? much to think about.</p>

    <p>im also going to be bad and order the tabi feet. goodbye money!</p>

    <p>i won a cute black and white seifuku on ebay and now that i have it i'm pretty sure it'll be too small in the waist for hina. I'll have to make a little extender for her. I can put it on my DD but its a very dark navy. im too scared. i won some 8-9 wigs too! i cant wait to try them on liam. poor dude. there is a shorter brown one in the set but it's still a bit long for a boy. it'll probably be an improvement over the pink one he's wearing now.</p>

    <p>i want to figure out how to make doll shoes sometime. it's too hard to find doll sized cowboy boots! i want all my dolls to be little cowboys ;a;</p>

    <p>i was surfing youtube again and found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2Pb-PPpqUc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKIDFKaqMXc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">videos</a>. While I wasn't super impressed with the quality of the finished product, that doll looks so happy and spoiled. I bet that ownder put in tons of house handsewing and embroidering that outfit! I hated it when she said "i didnt want to sand it so i just put glue on it". how painful to not take that small extra step...</p>
