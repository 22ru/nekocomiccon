	<h2>Space Bokeh</h2>
	<h4 class="date">October 22, 2022</h4>

	<p>A mysterious DoA user challenged me to do space bokeh after seeing my leaf bokeh photo. I accepted the challenge. This aperture has one space ship (or planet) and 3 little stars.</p>

	<p>Spoiler for 2 paragraphs from now: I now have enough doll stands for 4 1/3rd scale dolls. I'm trying to pose them together and make them all look natural but it's still a weakness of mine. Hina looks super stiff... I wasn't able to use the TV for eye contact due to Star Ocean: First Depature, but I did my best with what I had (a dying camera battery).</p>

	<p>I found a large amount of pokemon cards at the thrift store! My case it binder unsnapped itself before I even put the new cards in so it seems I need to be on the lookout for another binder. My binder is worth its weight in cuteness! It's heavy ;_;</p>

	<ul>
		<li>2 doll stands $1.50</li>
		<p>The cashier thought they were banana stands. She was very embarrassed when I told her they were for dolls.</p>
		<li>Pokemon the First Movie CD $1</li>
		<li>Eiffel 65 - Europop $1</li>
		<p>I almost didn't buy it because I thought Ryan had it. He says he doesn't. He does now.</p>
		<li>The Killers - Day and Age $1</li>
		<p>I think I own every CD by them I would ever want now.</p>
		<li>The Strokes - Is This It $1</li>
		<p>I've become very curious about american Julian Casablancas after reading the engrish lyrics he wrote for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5uQMwRMHcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instant Crush</a>.</p>
		<li>3 binder sheets of Yu-Gi-Oh cards $.50 each</li>
		<p>I was bad and swapped out the cards with other sheets for the best collection of cute girls. All the sheets were worthless on average so I don't think it's a big deal.</p>
		<li>bag of pokemon cards $.99</li>
		<li>Target preorder bonus Mario Kart 8 deluxe Kubrick's cube $.59</li>
		<li>Boltund tin of pokecards $3.95</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The contents of the boltund tin were pokemon go set mostly, with a bunch of the mcdonalds 2021 cards. I was only able to go to mcdonalds once during those happy meals so thank u for donating these!! I also didn't buy any packs of my own for Pokemon GO!</p>

	<p>The baggie had wizards cards and some from sets around 2015. The wizards cards were all in decent condition too. So strange. Ryan is going to beg me for a bunch of these to replace his more beat up cards. Overall, a very fun buy for just under $5 total.</p>

	<p>A couple months ago I was complaining to a friend that I couldn't find any vocaloid new wave. Well, it exists and is a (optionally) free download. Thanks <a href="https://astrophysicsbrazil.bandcamp.com/album/the-first-sound-of-the-future-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrophysics</a>!</p>

    <p>VolksUSA revealed their <a href="https://volksusa.com/event/202211oneoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holiday Greeting 2022 one-offs</a>. Smiling Michele is a very good addition, but none of them seem to be particularly exciting. I was considering a one-off Sui/Souseiseki or Miruku/Kurumi for a DSD, but neither of them are my ideal faceup, so I will sit this one out. F-100 may be the prettiest of them, but her head sculpt will be cheap in a few years and she has those cat/elf ears. I'd like her a lot more if she didn't!</p>

    <p>More dangerously, SD Severus Snape was announced. No photos yet. I do NOT want to order him through a proxy or a preorder so I will be crushed if he turns out to be gorgeous. PLEASE BE UGLY. Perhaps next year I'll buy Kinoko Juice's 58chan if they finally release her. I plan to make her Cheby's crush. No plans otherwise.</p>

    <p>Migi released "<a href="http://www.migidoll.com/shop/step1.php?number=1871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flora</a>" a week ago. She's incredibly pretty! Luckily, I am the opposite of a fan of <a href="http://www.migidoll.com/shop/step1.php?number=1792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Migidoll's bodies</a> and have no interest in hybriding again. Those elbows are hideous and I have multiple other problems with the body past that. I could never own such a body. If she came on the SDGr body I would be very tempted. I would have made her Liam's oneechan but then I'd also have to buy her a husband. It's a downward spiral from there.</p>

	<p>I went through dA looking for <a href="../stamps.html">stamps</a> after seeing them on hiritai's page. I found some good ones! And some bad ones! There were a lot of doll ones that were of people's personal dolls. The only one I liked enough to take was Hayden's. I'm still thinking about that dang doll even after getting my own.</p>
