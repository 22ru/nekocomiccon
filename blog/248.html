	<p>Low tide at the beach is my favorite! I love walking around playing with all the beach animals~ There's tiny crabbies, squirting clams, sand dollars, and... these things?!</p>

	<p>Now why, why would these things exist! Who thought these guys up!?</p>
	<img src="../img/CIA05801.jpg" />
	<p>These are geoducks! They're a burrowing clam that lives in the sand and have a long siphon that extends to the surface. You can find them at low tide in my location easily.</p>

	<p>The first time I saw a geoduck was at Seattle Uwajimaya. They keep live ones in tanks, so you get to see the whole shebang at once.</p>

	<p>My favorite geoduck activity is lightly poking them. They squirt water at you through one or both of their siphons and then pull their neck back into the sand.</p>

	<p>I was very tempted to dig one up and then let it go back into the water, but I found out they can't redig! I don't want to hurt them, so I won't dig one up.</p>

	<p>I've never tasted one, but this beach has a sign that warns of eating any sea life from this beach is a very bad idea due to pollution. Even if I had a fishing license, this is not a good place to find dinner.</p>

	<p>Here are two mostly hidden in the sand. Best friends probably.</p>
