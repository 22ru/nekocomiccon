	<p>I went back to Arizona with Ryan's family last weekend. Ryan saw a lizard and a tarantula, but I only got to see a bunny. Where da animals at???</p>

	<p>It was cactus fruit season! After confirming that there were no poisonous cactus fruits, I went out with Ryan's uncle and we picked a couple. One of us got more spikes in our hand than the other.</p>

	<p>Cactus fruit is great!! I haven't had it in a few years, but it's delicious after you spend 5 minutes carefully ripping the spines out. </p>

	<p>Sounds like it was the stormy season because we saw lightning pretty much every day. Also saw the strange singular raincloud dumping buckets of water in only one area. </p>

	<p>Ryan and I ended up in the guest house at the airbnb. It was a really cute little studio with a mini kitchen and washer/dryer. I don't think my doll collection and Ryan's video game collection will fit in it though so we can't move in.</p>

	<p>I was half asleep when I had the experience of feeling something hit my arm and hearing it bounce on to the bed. I thought I was just imagining it, but a few minutes later BUZZZZZ in my hair. Never sleep below the ceiling vent!!!!</p>

	<p>On the last night, Ryan played NSYNC videos for me on the TV!!!! Kyaaa~~~ I love NSYNC!!! XD</p>

	<p>I hate it when the CDs I want are donated to the expensive Goodwills in this area. Pls donate to St. Vinnie's next time. New Order's Republic and Erasure's The Innocents were also there. I already have them, so you can go buy them. I recommend both!</p>
