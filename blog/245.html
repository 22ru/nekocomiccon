	<ul>
		<li>Porcupine Tree - The Incident $.99</li>
		<p>I liked this one!! Just imagine my surprise when I found out a blindly bought an album from a former Japan member.</p>
		<li>Erase The Grey - 27 Days $.99</li>
		<li>Just Say Yo Vol. 2 $.99</li>
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wpHzRqR1I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Route 66/Behind The Wheel (Mega-Single Mix)</a> is pretty wild!!</p>
		<li>World Club Dome 2017 $.99</li>
		<p>It seems to be a rare pepe CD but it wasn't interesting. I can't tell if it's worth anything either because there's only 1 listing.</p>
		<li>Imari Tones - Japanese Pop $.99</li>
		<p>A signed copy. I looked it up and this is a Japanese Christian metal band. This is their last album before becoming a Christian band though. The singer is hella struggling with his English.</p>
		<li>Roxette - Joyride $1.99</li>
	</ul>
