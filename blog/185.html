    <p>Here we are again! New year coming up, new doll plans! Old doll plans! Let's get the <a href="136.html">old</a> out of the way first. </p>

    <h3>1. Buy every new issue of Volks News</h3>
    <p>Check!</p>
    
    <h3>2. A pair of shoes for every <s>child</s> doll</h3>
    <p>Mostly there. The tinies have a small shoe issue but who tf makes Kiki sized shoes?</p>
    
    <h3>3. Learn how to use my airbrush, if only for sealant. ‚ùå</h3>
    <p>Just used it for dusting again...</p>
    
    <h3>4. Locate and buy nice glass eyes (again) ‚ùå</h3>
    <p>Failed! Bought only 2 pairs.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Buy wigs</h3>
    <p>Very painfully expensive wig order was completed. I could have bought a doll with that money!</p>
    
    <h3>6. Make a decent wardrobe for the boys to share</h3>
    <p>The boys have clothes! Check!!! In fact, all my largies are exclusively wearing clothes made by me right now.</p>
    
    <h3>7. Buy Kinoko Juice 58chan, only enter lotteries for VERY precious dolls</h3>
    <p>KJ didn't even pretend to finish 58chan. I entered no lotteries even though I attempted to for RG Williams. My only resin purchases were some questionable choices and a new body for Liam. No new dolls.</p>
    
    <h3>8. Create a look for Verona that I'm happy with</h3>
    <p>The notes on this say I need to redo his faceup, but honestly just getting him wigs has made me happier with him. He's gotten some clothes too so he isn't wearing old scraps!</p>
    
    <h3>9. Attend a meetup ‚ùå</h3>
    <p>Where are you, doll girls...</p>

    <p>Something that wasn't on the list, but I'm very happy about, is that I fell in love with some of my dolls again and one for the first time.</p>

    <p>Rio was my first love! Last year I didn't really have any idea how to make him acceptable looking. I got him a new wig and made him a kimono and it reignited the flame of love for him! He even got a few more photos than just his birthday photos.</p>

    <p>I've never cared too much about Grassy. He barely even had a name. Wait did I name him that this year?? Just Did Not Care. I turned him into my bunny son and made him a little outfit and he's getting his turn out of the box now. He's very cute and I finally care about him!</p>

    <h2>My goals and plans for 2024</h2>

    <h3>1. Buy every new issue of Volks News</h3>
    <p>Easy peasy! Let's keep going!! I love buying magazines but this is the only periodical I'm interested in</p>

    <h3>2. Win Williams</h3>
    <p>üôè</p>

    <h3>3. More clothes!</h3>
    <p>I'd like to be able to pattern something more complex than casual clothes. MY BUTT NEEDS TO SEW SOMETHING KIKI SIZED NEXT YEAR. This is ridiculous.</p>

    <h3>4. Locate more leather doll shoes</h3>
    <p>Where in Mana-sama's name are they hiding?</p>
