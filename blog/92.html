    <p>I went out to take some hanami photos of hina! it was windier than i hoped but hina only fell on her face once. she's fine dont worry. i need a reflector or something next year but maybe it wouldn't help because of the wind anyway</p>

    <p>the little arbitrarium was surprisingly full compared to last year. there were a ton of families. one middle eastern couple with a little boy came up and asked to see her and the man even took photos of her! I ran into my manager from work and she thought hina was beautiful ;a;</p>

    <p>imagine if she had been my first doll and she fell on her face the first time i brought her outdoor. i would have cried!! 10+ dolls later i pick her up and go "hesus christ hina put yourself together!!"</p>
