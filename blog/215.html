	<p>I finally got to quit my job after 4.5 years. I'm very happy to be free, but I already miss my favorite coworkers. My work bestie even gave me a parting gift! She is so sweet ;u; I'll miss her so much!!!!</p>

	<img src="../img/CIA01018.jpg">

	<p>I've decided to use this chance to try out the new experience of being a homeless neet. Hopefully I'll make enough money from 1000円 paintings to eat!</p>

	<p>I've been trying to figure out the best way to pack all my d*ng dolls. It's not working and I'm gonna need a genius to help.</p>

	<p>I took a break from packing to take a portrait of Rio on his half day! What a pretty boy~ I'm also taking a break from packing right now. Do not tell Ryan.</p>

	</ul>

	<p>Ryan and I stopped by St. Vinny's and I headed over to the CD section to find someone had already sorted out all the good CDs. Thanks!</p>

	<p>We also found a record store downtown in his hometown and I sorted through the cheaper racks and found some good stuff. A lot of them were library discards.</p>

	<img src="../img/thrift/CIA00980.jpg"/>
	<ul>
		<li>Anatomy and Construction of the Human Figure $.75</li>
		<li>The Natural Way to Draw $1.50</li>
		<p>I still haven't read mine but this one is in much better condition than mine. I'm donating my old one. But I still don't know if I'm ready to draw naturally yet.</p>
		<li>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 $1</li>
		<p>You are probably asking why I bought a sports game. Bluegrass Tom did the soundtrack! I don't think I'd spend even a dollar more on this.</p>
		<li>jumbo book cover $.50</li>
		<li>Erasure - The Innocents $0</li>
		<p>This disc has the worst case of disc rot. I showed it to the record store guy selling it and he told me to take it. It was in the dollar bin anyway. I am pleased to say it had no issues ripping and is a very good album!</p>
		<li>Scritti Politti - Cupid & Psyche 85 $.50</li>
		<li>School of Fish - 3 Strange Days $.50</li>
		<li>Wham! - Fantastic $.50</li>
		<li>Aqua - Aquarium $5</li>
		<p>I bought it for Ryan but I didn't get to rip it.</p>
		<li>Metric - Art Of Doubt $1.67</li>
		<li>Japan - Oil on Canvas $1.67</li>
		<p>I was upset about accidentally buying a live version, but apparently only the drums were recorded live. The sparse audience noises must have been from thr groupies in the studio.</p>
		<li>CHVRCHΞS - Love Is Dead $1.67</li>
		<li>Bon Jovi - Crossroad $.50</li>
		<p>Now I can stop being upset about my Bon Jovi greatest hits being scratched to hell.</p>
		<li>Bryan Ferry - Roxy Music - Street Life - 20 Great Hits $.50</li>
		<li>P.O.D. - Murdered Love $1.67</li>
		<li>Lenny Kravitz - Circus $1.67</li>
		<p>Whoever decided the disc doesn't need his name on it, screw you.</p>
		<li>Missing Persons - The Best of Missing Persons $1.67</li>
	</ul>

	<img src="../img/thrift/CIA00982.jpg"/>
	<ul>
		<li>case club case $9.99</li>
