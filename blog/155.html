        <li>Paintings by Bai Xiaojun $.55</li>
        <p>I don't know the artist but these are pretty.</p>
        <li>The Buried Giant by Kazuo Ishiguro $1.45</li>
        <p>I found it with my eagle eyes!</p>
        <li>los del rio macarena bayside boys mix $.99</li>
        <li>Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics $.55</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I marked one doll resolution checked off the list. Everyone has a decent wig now, assuming the wigs I got for the BC twins fit them. Not everyone has shoes though. My final task is finding a pair for the BC twins. That body has awkward sized feet so it's not an easy task.</p>

    <p>Next on my list of doll purchases: eyes. This will probably be another painful one. I'm also planning on buying Hina a set of SDGr hands in May since they're available for SDGr Marie Antoinette. I think it'll be okay as long as I can stop myself from buying more dolls.</p>

    <p>I think I've already spent more this year than last year on dolls. My three major purchases were Praline, Hina's hand collection, and Cheby's body. I'm praying my hardest that having wigs for my tinies will make me want to get them out to play with them more.</p>

    <p>Maybe I should make another more realistic goal first. Perhaps cleaning the adhesive off Cheby's chest from the Mazel Tov nipple censor should be next.</p>
