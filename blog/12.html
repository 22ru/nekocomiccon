	<p>it's hideous and i want to wipe it right now. the eyelashes look like a fuzzy caterpillar up and died on her face. i went WAY too hard on her lower lashes god knows why</p>

	<p>for some reason the faceplate isnt fitting on the headback anymore.  not sure what to do about that. my sleeping faceplate has never fit on it, but sist did used to fit.</p>

	<p>in a moment of rage*, i pulled out my lusis faceplate and wiped her too. i did not even stop to take a before pic!</p>

	<p>*by rage i mean ive been thinking about redoing her for a few years. i did that faceup in 2013 when i got her.</p>

	<p>i'm happy with this one. im not sure about how prominent her eyebrows are and i went with a :3 but i think its better than her last one. she doesn't look like MY lusis anymore though and thats weird. ill probably get used to it</p>
