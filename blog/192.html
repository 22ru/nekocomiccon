    <p>I found a wooden book stand at the thrift store for $2.99 and bought it praying that it could hold my cintiq up. It works! I actually really appreciate the angle now. It's much better than hunching over my desk. I just hope it doesn't dump my tablet on the floor. It seems sturdy, but I'm still worried</p>

    <p>I'm gonna play so much OSU! with this bad boy!!!</p>

    <p>Please enjoy this rare glance at my desk. Not much room to write out my emails... or my blog... I thought the little handles were going to be annoying, but the left one never gets in the way of my arm. The right one has to be placed carefully or it is annoying.</p>

    <p>I got <a href="https://github.com/22ru/chiizukeiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chiizukeiki</a> up to functional after thinking it was done and then realizing I can't hold ctrl or shift. Big oversight! I noticed the songs in my playlist in Clementine started disappearing after starting to use it, but the playlist is restored the next time I open it. Did I do that?!</p>
