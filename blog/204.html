    <p>I'm not done, but I finally hit the credits in Pokemon Arceus. I've been calling it Arkeous but I've heard other call it Arseus? Ark-phone? Arse-phone?? Anyway, the game is good and a lot of fun and they gave us two great boys, Volo and Adaman. I'm very happy with how much time they let me spend with Adaman!!! He's so cute~</p>

    <p>And finally... we went to Gamer's Tavern. The owner said video games were 20% off. So I did it. I bought a Wii U. I've been wanting to for a while, but was hesitating dropping money on it. I don't think I'll be lucky enough to find a thrift store one, so this is probably the best deal I'll find. Time to make a Wii U game wishlist. A few things were also at goodwill next door. </p>

    <p>We went back a bit later and got a couple more things that were not pictured. If you are very upset at nofoto, please send me an email and tell me "pix or it didnt happen".</p>

    <p>Also a few more cards at Gamer's Tavern. Ryan and I went looking for Adaman, but found Volo instead. Volo is pretty pretty good though so I'm happy. There were so many cards I wanted but I held back! Top row is mine, bottom is Ryan's.</p>
