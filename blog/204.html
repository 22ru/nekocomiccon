    <p>I'm not done, but I finally hit the credits in Pokemon Arceus. I've been calling it Arkeous but I've heard other call it Arseus? Ark-phone? Arse-phone?? Anyway, the game is good and a lot of fun and they gave us two great boys, Volo and Adaman. I'm very happy with how much time they let me spend with Adaman!!! He's so cute~</p>
