	<p>I took a ton of doll portraits today and updated the staff photos in the cafe so mooooost of them are matching. Can you believe I took my minis out?? It's only been forever. Just Rio fought me today so it was a good day.</p>

	<p>You can see them all <a href="https://22ru.github.io/tophatcafe/staff/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>! Their page portraits even match the thumbnails. I'm sorry the portrait for Olivia and Sophie is over 10 years old. I saw them a few weeks ago but didn't even bother to take a decent photo of them. Just one at midnight for Mima... Good news is their new wigs fit them.</p>

	<p>I've got enough lenses now that I should sit down and write a page for all of them. Mostly so I can remember the filter sizes of each when I'm out and about... Maybe someone will be interested in their peculiarities though. I just had this wicked idea to put close up lenses on my 75-200 brb</p>

	<p>I hope every Persona 3 lover has seen that Limited Run Games is printing P3P. I didn't buy it for PSP when it was $20 (because I didn't have a PSP and I was BROKE AF) and I really regret it! This one has the JP voices so that's as good as it'll get! I'll have to play the girl side again so I can hear the sweet voice of my boyfriend, Ryoji.</p>

	<p>There was also a mention for P4G and they said there will be overlaps for the preorders for both so guess I'll be spending another $35 to listen to my other boyfriend, <s>Teddie</s> Kuma.</p>

	<p>I hope whoever wrote this review did not take it up as their career.</p>

	<p>Now that I have a pair of my own headphones, I've been looking into MP3 players since I can't find the lightning to 3.5mm adapter for my phone. Win 7 doesn't recognize my newest SSD (which is probably a quick driver fix) and iTunes is such a pain in the butt, so I'd love to move away from it. I used to use the foobar2000 add on for my iPod nano 3rd gen, but the battery on that baby was not doing so hot 10 years ago, so I quit using it. I never got it to work with my iPhone. Why is copying files to a device THIS hard? Just let me copy the file!!!</p>
