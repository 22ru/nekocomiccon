	<p>I made my neocities account 9 years ago today! What was I doing 9 years ago? Probably sitting on my computer in my bedroom at my mom's house watching tweetdeck waiting for a killer joke to appear.</p>

	<p>You can see the original neocities hatsite over in the archive, but prepare by closing your eyes first.</p>

    <p>Ryan and Makoto both participated in the thanksgiving challenge. Ryan drank 2 lattes and one very large french press. Makoto drank 1 latte and one double shot americano. I drank 2 lattes and a very tiny cup of Ryan's french press. Ryan came out as the winner of being the most jittery and chemically compromised. Congratuations, Ryan!</p>

    <p>What's up with people buying Scarlet and Violet. It's no secret this game is half baked and worse than the last one. This is going to be a top selling game despite being a broken mess? Game Freak and Nintendo won't learn any lessons if their trash games are megahits. I WANT this series to be good again. Unfortunately my wallet alone isn't very loud. I'll consider buying them when Ultraviolet comes out. Maybe it'll be less of a disaster.</p>

	<p>Speaking of video games, I finally dumped the dead man's file off the LoZ Seasons cart I have. The owner of the game killed himself approximately 15 years ago. Now that it is safe, I cannot receive the dead man's save curse.</p>
