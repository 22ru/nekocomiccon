    <p>Ryan and Makoto both participated in the thanksgiving challenge. Ryan drank 2 lattes and one very large french press. Makoto drank 1 latte and one double shot americano. I drank 2 lattes and a very tiny cup of Ryan's french press. Ryan came out as the winner of being the most jittery and chemically compromised. Congratuations, Ryan!</p>

    <p>What's up with people buying Scarlet and Violet. This is going to be a top selling game despite being a broken mess? Game Freak and Nintendo won't learn any lessons if you make their trashed games megahits. I WANT these games to be good again. Unfortunately my wallet alone doesn't speak much. I'll consider buying them when Ultraviolet comes out. Maybe it'll be less of a disaster.</p>

	<p>I finally dumped the dead man's file off the LoZ Seasons cart I have. The owner of the file killed himself approximately 15 years ago. Now that it is safe, I cannot receive the dead man's file curse.</p>
