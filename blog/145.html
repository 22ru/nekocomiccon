    <p>I cleaned out my spresso machine last night. My dear Cheby gets to be my obsessive hobby otaku doll every time. How many hobbies will I give him?</p>

    <p>I kinda broke it though I think? If you turn the steam valve knob while steam isn't pressed, water runs out of the brew head as well. I don't remember it doing that before... It's such a mess of wires inside I feel overwhelmed looking at it.</p>

    <p>I found out yesterday that Kame will take custom orders. Absolutely dangerous information. My dreams of having a Shizuku on a Kiki body are entirely possible. Unfortunately, losing the chance to buy a doll makes you want it even more. I am doing my best to stay strong though. I must hold out for a lovely 58chan.</p>

    <p>Big news for avid doll questionnaire readers! Both <a href="https://mydollyadventures.blogspot.com/2023/01/bjd-questions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Musume</a> and <a href="https://doll.greatskyriver.net/100-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vega</a> have filled out the 100 questions! I'm really happy with how it turned out. The questions that were chosen can get some really fun to read answers. I really like reading about people's hobby experiences.</p>

        <li>Hawaiian coconut soap $.50</li>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTJncWndUB8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dota 2</a> international championships jacket $4.50</li>
        <p>Ryan bought it for me. It's an inside joke...</p>

        <li>4x playing cards $.59 each</li>
        <p>Ryan needed these for his office</p>
        <li>DVD binder full of movies $5</li>
        <p>I've never wanted to yell at another customer more after he saw me find this and tell us FIVE TIMES we need to have it priced. Ryan did yell at him. f*** off, dude. I'm pretty sure this dude doesn't have a job and just picks all day instead because I see him every time I go.</p>
        <li>2023 animal calendar $.49</li>
        <p>Ryan didn't want my Ronald Reagan calendar above the sink. Edit: He's letting me keep my Ronnie calendar above the sink.</p>
        <li>Japan Fashion Now $7</li>
        <p>A 2010 book. Hangry and Angry are on the cover so it was fate! Has designer, street fashion, and just a little historical from what I can see.</p>
        <li>Making Kimono and Japanese Clothes by Jenni Dobson $9</li>
        <p>I was eyeing this book last year and I finally just bought it. The author has a bit of an obsession with patchwork but she seems to know what she's doing. Time to find out I've been making doll kimono the hard way.</p>
        <li>Not pictured: glass bowl $2.99</li>
        <p>Also for Ryan's office</p>
    </ul>
