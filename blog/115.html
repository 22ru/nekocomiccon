	<h2>Splatreview 3</h2>
	<h4 class="date">August 27, 2022</h4>


    <p><a href="https://lhfm.neocities.org/" target="_blank">LiterallyHifumi</a> listened to my suggestion and made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhIBNmNJRj4kJL7jccJJVyeTdm-m6zV-U" target="_blank">YouTube playlist</a> of his singing synthesizer pages! Bless my lazy butt. Please listen to it!</p>

	<p>I played the Splatfest world premiere! I prepared myself for the inability to use my wrist for a week and booted up my ACNH/Splatoon switch. I dumbly did not check with my friends before choosing a team so I played alone. ._.; It really is more fun to play with friends.</p>

	<p>The upgrades in the lobby are great! Playing with the targets is so much nicer than waiting on a screen. I guess I don't need a secondary switch to play animal crossing in lobby screens anymore.</p>

	<p>The new songs were fun. I wasn't quite grooving as much as I did with the Off the Hook songs but I probably never will again. The main splatfest theme is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87K5Uh3AML0" target="_blank">Nippon Egao Hyakkei</a>. Shivers is still a megatwink and you cannot change my mind. Frye (AKA me timbers) said she was a girl so I'll believe her for now. I'm still not sure what breed of cephalopod she is... </p>

	<p>The 3 way battles were confusing as all heck. I still don't know what the ultra signal is but if everyone wants to stand in the same place in range of my charger that doesn't upset me. I'm 90% sure it's a waste of time to cover the other color on your team other than to move around, but a lot of players were covering everything. I'm sure my single teammate in my color was pissed at me for bringing a charger to a turf war, as usual.</p>

	<p>I did have someone disconnect early in the battle and surprisingly, the match ended in a draw immediately?! Later, I had a match where someone's connection got etchy sketchy and it let me finish out the match as the only one on my team against 2 on the other.</p>

	<p>I got my first 100x battle ever (I think)! And I won it! Too bad it was all off the record. I also got like 4 or 5 10x battles which is unusual to me.</p>

	<p>They added discord like numbers to the end of nicknames. I'm not sure what the purpose is yet, but I really don't need to be properly identified in a game for children. I also had to disable user generated content. It's too much for me. Kids are too much for me.</p>


    <p>I made some polymer eye bases on Sunday. I painted a purple pair that night and added glaze. The next morning I painted the blue/yellow pair and glazed it. It was Friday before the blue/yellow pair cleared up and the purple ones still aren't clear almost a week later. The polymer clay just must take a lot longer to dry on top of.</p>

	<p>Polymer eyes on top, original air dry on bottom.</p>

    <p>I started reading the first pages of The Natural Way to Draw. This dude seriously requires a live model, preferably nude. Now how in the heck were people supposed to hire a nude model if they couldn't afford classes and only this book? We are too blessed to have an internet full of naked people to draw for free. Or are we?</p>

    <p>He also requires you to draw in 3 hour uninterrupted sessions. Like this dude is serious!!! I'm definitely not going to pay someone to sit naked in front of me while I scribble on the page. It's 2022 though! I can make some substitutions and he will never know because he died before he could even finish the dang book.</p>
