	<p><a href="https://kohidate.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohi</a> asked me if I wanted to go to a community yard sale in Tacoma. Now, usually I like to avoid risking my life in Tacoma without bodyguards, but for a big yard sale? I'm in.</p>

	<p>It was in a neighborhood called Fircrest which was actually very clean and safe. If you are moving to Tacoma, check this place out!</p>

	<p>I probably had the worst find of any of my yard sale runs! I spent a total of $1 on the hair thinning scissors and the rest was free. I saw nothing really worth buying. There were very few old items. I can't tell if it's because this is a yearly event and everyone already sold their old stuff or if everyone in this area hasn't lived there very long. A lot of items were new and lower quality. If I needed to recreate my kitchen, I could have gotten some good deals, but my kitchen is in a storage unit so no need for that. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>11x14 floating frame</li>
		<li>small hawaii bag</li>
		<p>put some pens in it probably. you know I have no shortage of pens.</p>
		<li>2 leather bookmarks</li>
		<li>hair thinning scissors marked $5</li>
		<li>clip chip</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I always enjoy spending time with Kohi though so I'm not complaining. Fircrest was a lovely neighborhood to explore and everyone was friendly.</p>

	<p>I finally got out the hair straightener, foam ball, hair gel, etc to style Volta's 2 new wigs. I didn't love how the Leeke wig with the blonde strip turned out and I'll try again, but here's the Msire wig. </p>

	<p>I was inspired to take another family portrait after styling wigs for Volta. I didn't have a TV this time to check eye contact from a distance but I made it happen. It's been a whole year since the last one!</p>

	<img src="../cafe/img/familyportrait/CIA06021.jpg">

	<p>I somehow posed Volta's hand in exactly the wrong place and posted it online before noticing his... anyway! It's photoshopped now! Nothing to see here!</p>
