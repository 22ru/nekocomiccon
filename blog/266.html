	<p>I hate to admit it to you all, but once again, I am gold nibless.</p>

	<p>My experience with my LAMY 14k nib was not matching my experience at Oblation. It had the nice bouncy feel, but it wasn't nearly as smooth as the one I tried. My LAMY F nibs in steel aren't scratchy, but this nib was. I was beginning to think I was going crazy. Was I using the wrong paper? I don't have any Tomoe River paper like I was using for testing at the store, but I could feel it catching on all of my nicer papers.</p>

	<p>After a few days of thinking "I really need to get my close up filters out and take a peek", I finally did it and found the probable cause: the tip is pointed towards the left.</p>

	<p>Not only is the nib pointed towards the left, the slit through the nib is straight through, which means this nib was not dropped and this was a manufacturing defect. LAMY did not catch this at the QC level either. Allegedly, they test each of their nibs, so I don't know how they missed this one.</p>

	<p>You'll also notice the rounded engraving is misaligned. This is just embellishment, but disappointing to see. I wasn't going to complain over this, but since I'm already complaining...</p>

	<p>I emailed <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JetPens</a> with the photo and they said they would replace it for me. I sent the nib back on Tuesday using their prepaid return label. It won't arrive at their warehouse until Monday. JetPens warned me that they only process returns once a week, but didn't say which day either. They're a smaller company, so that's understandable, but gosh I am antsy!! I'm a little worried the next nib will also come with issues. I'll give it a proper photoshoot to check much earlier. </p>

	<p>I'm a little worried the next nib will also come with issues. I'll give it a proper photoshoot to check much earlier and trust my gut more. I noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1p237ml/my_new_lamy_lx_is_special/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user</a> coping with a misaligned engraving on a steel nib. Fortunately their nib works, but LAMY is not checking their $16 nibs or their $125 nibs. Shout out to the user who criticized LAMY and was downvoted for speaking the truth. Reddit is truly a terrible place.</p>

	<p>As a bonus, here's Diamine Cherry Sunburst in comparison with a Epiphone Les Paul Cherry Sunburst! For some reason I didn't even consider making this comparison when I got it in. It's browner than red, but I wonder if they averaged the golden and red tones to create this color. Honestly, a cream colored pen might work for a Yui themed pen as well.</p>
