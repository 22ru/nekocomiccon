    <p>OKAY! Here is attempt 3 at talking about Tiny Tim. I know you have been all waiting excitedly for it for the last couple weeks. A few people commented on my itabag and asked if the guy in the photo was young Weird Al. Only 2 people recognized him as Tiny Tim. He was sent home with the two, Flan and Tae. I'm honestly really shocked anyone could talk to me with a straight face and also that he wasn't recognized.</p>

    <p>I'm sure a lot of my viewers are 13 years old (go outside), so I'll bring him to your attention. Go to youtube and look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbUes5Z3Whg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiptoe through the Tulips</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy-TfimLA2U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living in the Sunlight</a>. Now that you are initiated, my dear 13 year old anti-shipper (whatever that means), please watch his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ypcn-YxqF0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">televised wedding</a>.</p>

    <p>Next time I make a Tiny Tim joke, I expect one laugh minimum.</p>

	<p>Ryan took me shopping~~~ I love shopping~~~</p>

	<img src="../img/thrift/LOL09646.jpg"/>

	<ul>
		<li>The The - Dusk $1</li>
        <p>No one in this band anticipated google.</p>
		<li>Mudvayne - The End Of All Things To Come $1</li>
        <li>This is a lot better than the last album of theirs I got. There is no song called "poop loser" on this one and that is a good thing.</li>
		<li>The Stranger by Alber Camus $1.99</li>
		<p>Ryan was complaining that his copy made noises when you moved the spine! Must have been very annoying!</p>
		<li>Magaman Battle Network Legacy Collection $37.99</li>
		<p>Ryan's, but it looks pretty kawaii.</p>
		<li>J-Lo - On the 6 $1</li>
		<p>Ryan's.</p>
		<li>Pop Evil - Lipstick On The Mirror $1</li>
		<li>Enigma - MCMXC a.D. $.49</li>
        <p>I've seen this one around a lot, but wasn't willing to pay $3 for it. It's good though. Would recommend.</p>
		<li>The Wallflowers - Bringing Down the Horse $.49</li>
        <p>I misread the title and googled "wallflowers burning down the house". It wasn't helpful. Ryan said there was a good song on it so I picked it up anyway.</p>
		<li>Kageki Shojo!! Vol 1 $1.99</li>
		<p>Eh?! It's a sequel?! This series is already too complicated.</p>
		<li>Persona 5 Royal steelbook $14.99</li>
		<p>I actually don't own this game in any form. Not sure if I'm willing to play it a second time for Royal.</p>
        <li>Elbow patches $.99</li>
		<p>I hope my master plan to make a camera strap with this works out!</p>
        <li>1 yard black fabric (nice) $5.50</li>
		<p>I was desperate enough to buy a remnant and not wait for more to show up at the thrift store.</p>
	</ul>

    <img src="../img/thrift/LOL09653.jpg"/>

	<ul>
		<li>Documanager $.89</li>
		<p>Ryan suggested one of these for storing doll patterns and it's crazy enough it just might work</p>
		<li>Shipping tape $.99</li>
		<p>I ran out a few months ago</p>
        <li>Cross ballpoint pen $1.49</li>
		<p>Also included: lots more pen and pencil trash</p>

		<li>Penny sleeves $.49</li>
		<li>Toploaders $.49</li>
		<li>Make Your Own Japanese Clothes $.55</li>
		<p>I want to be as cool as the guy inside wearing monpe on a skateboard with a parrot.</p>
        <li>Leuchtturm1917 2021 planner $.99</li>
		<p>I'm going to ignore the dates because I want a fountain pen friendly notebook for secret reasons. Why does my favorite pen bleed through everything ;_;</p>
		<li>Train - Save Me, San Francisco $.99</li>
        <li>H₂O - F.T.T.W. $.99</li>
		<p>This is not good and the longest track is 2:36 with most of them being under 2 minutes.</p>
		<li>Silverchair - Freak Show $.99</li>
		<li>Mad At Gravity - Resonance $.99</li>
		<p>It wasn't vacuum sealed, but was sealed with a sticky cover. Is it that bad?! I really like their sound.</p>
		<li>Incubus - Monuments and Melodies $.99</li>
		<p>Score!!!! It's a greatest hits, but has a few songs I haven't been able to find yet, some from a movie OST I didn't know about, with a few more that aren't released elsewhere. Not a single song from Fungus Amongus is on this! I'll never find that CD. The oldest song is an acoustic version of a song from S.C.I.E.N.C.E. on it.</p>
		<li>Daryl Hall & John Oates - Private Eyes $.99</li>
		<p>SCORE!!!!!! I love them so much omg. I need all of their albums released in the 80s. I can only find greatest hits albums and it's very frustrating.</p>
        <li>Sia - 1000 Forms of Fear $.99</li>
		<p>I hope the guy on /g/ who posts his Sia themed battlestation has some taste in music. This purchase was for you, dude.</p>

	<p>More scary Hina? More scary Hina!!! Every version of Hina is perfect. It was <a href="85.html">2 years ago</a> when I first discovered scary Hina and also that Liam is her favorite fashion accessory.</p>

	<p>I made her a skirt out of two old tshirts. The black shirt was one of mine and the red was Ryan's madotsuki shirt. Not sure why it was red. It is actually double layered and oh my gosh that waistband is thick. I probably should have faked the layering. She's wearing Cheby's black tank top, but I really need to pattern one that fits her better.</p>

	<img src="../cafe/img/gallery/hina/LOL09676.jpg"/>

	<p>And now, it's Hina's turn for a midnight photoshoot</p>

	<img src="../cafe/img/gallery/hina/LOL09682.jpg"/>
	<img src="../cafe/img/gallery/hina/LOL09693.jpg"/>
	<img src="../cafe/img/gallery/hina/LOL09703.jpg"/>
	<img src="../cafe/img/gallery/hina/LOL09719.jpg"/>
	<img src="../cafe/img/gallery/hina/LOL09747.jpg"/>

	<p>I put the leather ring I was given at the h.NAOTO VIP event on Hina's arm and it's a tight fit, but it works! What a spooky lil top hat skeleton guy. It's not really my personal style, but it's cute on my Hina. She gets to wear brand!!!</p>

	<p>Ryan says I'm just recreating Misa Amane, but is that so bad???</p>
