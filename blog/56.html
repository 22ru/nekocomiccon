    <p>people keep talking about watching "squid game" and i keep wondering how they're just watching splatoon. it seems to be a korean show though...</p>

    <p>anyway i drew a wooper. and tried to do a photostudy of a splendid fairywren that is in my calendar. he's very splendid indeed!!!</p>

    <p>i was going to practice faceups today and the i woke up to see snow falling. i hope i dont have to wait a few months if the weather only gets colder. i was thinking about wiping my lusis faceplate along with sist last night but now im glad i didnt!!</p>

    <p>i did boil the faceplates that weren't fitting on the headbacks to get them on. it worked pretty well! oyasumi is still very tight and needed a whole minute instead of just 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>i think oyasumi is criminally underrated btw. she has such a gentle smile. i was so bummed when i got her and she didnt fit on the headback. a few friends suggested she might be a recast but that's silly to think since she matches a body from well before recasts perfectly. i know those guys werent out there slaving away to perfectly color match a 10 year old body. im also not even sure oyasumi has been recasted. she's pretty unpopular and not in any lusis or sist recast sets. h*ck i dont even see her on the alchemic labo eshop!!</p>

    <p>i tried to sketch her too. im not great at all at this but practice makes perfect. my white gel pens were too thick and betrayed me. i gotta start bigger next time.</p>

    <p>im getting super close to the 180 day paypal protection limit for hina and it's freaking me out a little. i have very few doubts volks will disappear but what my mom said months ago about me eventually getting screwed over is stuck in my head. I never want to do a long preorder again regardless of many companies having great reputations. hopefully in a few days when I am fully at mother SD's mercy i'll calm down.</p>

    <p>i changed a lot of my doll opinions page on chinese dolls. it's more of a complex subject than i made it out to be. here's a <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/on-respecting-chinese-bjd-artists.680403/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a> that brings a little more light to the subject. there really are some beautiful chinese dolls out there, but so many of them are sculpted without soul. if you look at <a href="https://mintyliciousbjd.tumblr.com/post/130883946164/%C2%BC-mini-girl-comparison-sadly-i-couldnt-fit-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSD body comparison photos</a> you can really see it. I am 100% not talking about stylization either. angel fantasy has some slenderman tier arms for example. I've seen some hand comparisions where the hands are almost noodle tubes attached to a rectangle. they just feel so cheaply made. i also dislike relatively large wrist joints with thin hands and a ton of chinese companies do that.</p>

    <p>i also saw in oueneifs factory photos that there are people with cheap blue surgeons masks sanding resin which just kills me. i know that company doesnt care about anything but money but do they really expose their workers to that unsafe of conditions? i suppose they can just find a new sander when the one they have develops lung cancer. i'm actually super disgusted by this im sorry.</p>

    <p>theres also pictures of their faceup artists in regular masks too. its possible (but unlikely) theres a fume hood out of the picture, so i wont freak out about that one yet.</p>
