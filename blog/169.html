    <p>I </p>

    <p>I've been listening to a few of my old CDs that I hadn't ripped yet. I was really surprised to only know the two singles off Shinedown's Leave a Whisper. I was even more surprised that I could half-sing all of A Change of Pace's An Offer You Can't Refuse! I guess that clears up what I was listening to as a teen.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Hanson - This Time Around $1</li>
        <li>Pet Shop Boys - Can You Forgive Her $1</li>
        <li>Shinedown - Sound of Madness $.49</li>
        <p>Completed my 3 CD collection of music I would know from them.</p>
        <li>Tally Hall - Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum $.49</li>
        <p>it was unopened (before I opened it). time to find out if the neocities babies have bad taste or ....??? it's fine so far. it's gag music, but it doesn't bother me like aquabats</p>
        <li>Tarja - What Lies Beneath $1</li>
        <li>GITS $12</li>
        <p>Today I learned that they censored a lesbian sex scene in this.</p>
