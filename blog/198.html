    <p>I've been trying to optimize midnight photoshoots.</p>

    <p>I tried adding diffraction grating in front of my lens. Silly me forgot diffraction doesn't look particularly interesting in nearly monochrome situations. It does add a good ghosty look, but much more color is needed for the full effect!</p>

    <p>I tried taking some with my 75-200mm zoom lens. It really didn't work out and he fell over twice so I called it quits for the evening. Wide open at f/4.6, the minimum ISO it would choose was 6400.</p>

    <p>I tried with Cheby as well back on the 50mm f/1.4. It still wouldn't drop under 6400 ISO. The harsh lighting really took the contrast out of his face and he looks strangely vulnerable.</p>

    <p>The feel like the shots in <a href="196.html">blog 196</a> were better and I can't remember how to recreate them. I was able to keep the ISO at 100 without having to use a tripod somehow. Only the first 2 of those 5 photos were taken using a tripod and I was surprised when I tried it off the tripod that it worked so well! Maybe it's the white background that is making the difference to the ISO choosing function.</p>

    <p>Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden for Switch arrived the other day. I bought them from LRG a few months ago.</p>

    <p>I still have a ton of games I haven't started and even a few I haven't opened. I almost finished Pokemon Arceus, but there's just so many things I want to do more!!</p>

    <p>I don't feel too guilty about buying these two even if I don't play them. They both have the Japanese audio and I never owned a physical copy of P3P. Both of these games are in my 3x3!!!</p>

    <p>Someone is going to have to tell me how great Unicorn Overlord is because I shouldn't buy it.</p>
