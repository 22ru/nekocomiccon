	<p>This year in white elephant, I brought a handsome Lion by Bradley's. He was marked $44!! I wonder who bought him for that much...</p>

	<p>I left with a snack pack from the Phillipines. Ryan's aunt was so disgusted by everything in it that she didn't think anything in her gift would be eaten. Nothing in it has tasted bad so far. This gift totally failed on me because I don't find any of it gross. The ube spread is not even close to offensive in any way shape or form.</p>

	<p>I'm sure you've all been waiting to see what kind of card my old friend <a href="https://x.com/maullarmaullar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maullarmaullar</a> sent out for 2024. I always am! I don't know who the character is, but the design is cute. It's a girl noticing you while looking at her phone!</p>

	<p>My friend and I met up to welcome the new year with a doll meetup at a cafe! She brought her Minifee Celine and Unoa Lusis~</p>

    <img src="https://22ru.github.io/tophatcafe/img/gallery/other/CIA03630.jpg">

	<p>We got back and I pulled out the rest of the dolls I have with me. While at the cafe, little Lusis was unable to sit up. When we got back, I stole her and restrung her. I actually had help for the first time restringing and it's a game changer. Definitely bring a friend if you can. Lusis can sit quite happily now! My friend quickly changed a sweater from one doll to another and created MATCHING CUTIES!!!!</p>

	<p>They're so cute!!! I guess this is what happens when I make doll clothes for my friends.</p>

	<p>The full group!! Kyaaaa I can't get over how cute the matchers are together~~</p>
