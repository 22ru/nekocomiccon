    <p>My mom came to visit so we did traditional thrift shopping. I enjoy it more than her other hobbies which include gnomes, youtube, and television craft supply shopping.</p>

        <p>Never heard of them.</p>
        <li>Backstreet Boys - Backstreet Boys</li>
        <p>Ryan already had it and I guess I didn't rip it! Oops!</p>
        <li>Diesel - Hepfidelity</li>
        <p>Allegedly this CD went triple platinum in Australia. Never heard of it.</p>
        <li>Deep Blue Something - Home</li>
        <p>Probably a one hit wonder.</p>
        <li>Gregorian - Masters of Chant</li>

        <li>Letter Kills - The Bridge</li>
        <li>Level 42 - Running In The Family</li>
        <li>One Direction - Midnight Memories</li>
        <p>I don't know any of their songs due to not listening to the radio. I wasn't super impressed with my first listen.</p>
        <li>Pet Shop Boys - Actually</li>
        <li>Pet Shop Boys - Very</li>
        <p>This album has a very cool case that I immediately broke when taking the disc out to check for scratches.</p>
        <li>Rob Thomas - ...Something To Be</li>
        <li>SR-71 - Tomorrow</li>
        <p>No idea what this is. He has a bit of a whiny voice.</p>

        <p>Score!! Ryan found this one for me. Gimme Schrei next!! Wait why do I already recognize half this CD???</p>
        <li>100% Pure Dance</li>
        <p>Ryan's. I keep asking him if it's good and he keeps saying he hasn't listened to it yet!</p>
        <li>Will Smith - Lost and Found</li>
        <p>Ryan's</p>
    </ul>

    <p>My mom picked out CDs too. She got the two Simply Red and The Carpenters pictured. There were about 6 more not pictured. She picked the ones I thought went straight to the trash. I gave her my Foreigner CD too since I wasn't into it more than one song.</p>


    <p>My mom has a pair of these little bears in her house and she wouldn't let me steal them. I found these and she wanted them to match hers because she couldn't even remember she has the EXACT same ones.</p>

    <img src="../img/LOL02068.jpg" />

    <p>Their clothes are very sun damaged but these little bears are irrestibly cute. They're strung but their elastic was long destroyed. Luckily, this kind of restringing is babby tier to me.</p>

    <p>Seriously so cute. Next themed cafe I open will be bear themed. Back in the 90s, there was a doll and bear store in the mall of my hometown. How I wish I could have worked there!</p>
