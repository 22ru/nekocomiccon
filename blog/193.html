    <p>I hope you all had a great Valentine's Day!! Ryan took me shopping so I was happy!</p>

    <p>I took some photos of Hina and Verona together. They're both my ultra cuties!! I accept both of their chocos ♥</p>

    <p>I helped Ryan take a Freddy birthday photo too. We went out and bought some macarons for the shoot! There's two pistachio and one lavender.</p>
