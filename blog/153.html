    <p>I was wanting to try making monpe so I was googling around and I found this <a href="https://masachuka.com/2022/03/07/please-make-your-own-monpe-pants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pattern</a> made of boxes and triangles. I divided the measurements by 3 and started cutting.</p>

    <p>My first mistake was to NOT look at the diagram while assembling them. I paid for that mistake in seam ripping. There's an unavoidable 3 seam intersection that I found difficult to sew, but the rest of it was fairly simple (after looking at the instructions).</p>

    <p>I'm having Cheby model it, but I think this color combo would look much better on Verona. I'll have to make these pieces again in black or something.</p>

        <p>I've been curious if copics would work on this. They don't at all! Don't bother trying it.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>I found Black Eyed Peas and Pussycat Dolls with the CDs I bought. There's some music I wouldn't seek out, but I would own for nostalgia of the time and then there's the Black Eyed Peas. No thanks.</p>
