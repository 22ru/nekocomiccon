    <p>I was wanting to try making monpe so I was googling around and I found this super simple <a href="https://masachuka.com/2022/03/07/please-make-your-own-monpe-pants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pattern</a> made of boxes and triangles. I divided the measurements by 3 and started cutting.</p>

    <p>My first mistake was to NOT look at the diagram while assembling the pieces. I paid for that mistake in seam ripping. There's an unavoidable 3 seam intersection that I found difficult to sew, but the rest of it was fairly simple (after looking at the instructions).</p>

    <p>I also made a tank top. I couldn't wait to wash/heat the frixion ink off it to try it on! I'm having Cheby model them, but I think this set combo would look better on Verona. I'll have to make these pieces again in black. That being said, I still have him in it while he sits next to me while I write this! He's so cute!!!</p>

    <p>Please check out the <a href="https://22ru.github.io/tophatcafe/bulletin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bulletin board</a> I made for my cafe over the last 2 days! Send me a photo of your doll(s) if you want me to add it (*´∀`*) I have support for instax square and wide too. It was Ryan's midnight idea and hors helped me with CSS (as always). Thank you Ryan and hors!</p>

    <p>I found Black Eyed Peas and Pussycat Dolls with the CDs I bought. There's some music I wouldn't seek out, but I would own for nostalgia of the time and then there's the Black Eyed Peas. No thanks.</p>
