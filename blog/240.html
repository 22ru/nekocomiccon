	<p>His name is Slithers Slugsworth and he my new very cute pet yard snake. He's very small and I'm worried he may be mistaken for a worm and eaten by a robin.</p>

	<p>I got to give him his new eyes and wig. I think they look very cute on him. He'll be sittin around for a while. Grassy Knoll is back too! But not Rio, who spent his 16th birthday yesterday not in my arms. :c</p>
