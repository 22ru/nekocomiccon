    <p>Last time I was at my mom's house, she told me our old family computer was fried and that my sister's father in law wanted to toss the whole thing. Excuse me?!</p>

    <p>So time was of the essence before the computer I spent years using disappeared. I took the leaf blower to the chassis (fun) and then took it back up to my old bedroom to see how fried it actually was.</p>

    <p>I was surprised to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MqWSEtcDx_Y" target="_blank">he was right</a>. I left my room to go grab something and halfway down the stairs I hear THIS from my keyboard. My best guess from this paranormal activity is the PSU is hecked, but I feel no need to save the whole computer. The files are good enough for me.</p>

    <p>I realized I had nothing else with an IDE connector in the house, so I packed up the HDD and brought it back with me.</p>

    <p>My first and simplest plan was to plug it into the computer Ryan bought in <a href="98.html">blog 98</a> and back it up. This plan worked... at the speed of snails. I know, I know. I could have left it overnight and it would be done by now. It just made the awful old fan sound and was so slow and</p>

    <p>So I pulled out my super janky IDE to USB 2.0 connector. I had already been sorting through my various cables that day and found a PS/2 power supply. What in the literal heck uses PS/2 as a power source?? I had already thrown it in the toss pile when I pulled out the IDE to USB 2.0 board and sure enough, I would have regretted tossing this one.</p>

    <p>I got it to work for one of Ryan's IDE drives that was sitting around, but mine is giving me trouble. I've tried it on master, slave, cable select. I also tried it with a external HDD case I have that has an IDE slot, but I don't have the older power connector so I hooked it up to the other janky board and my desk is a disaster. Eventually, I got win7 to detect it and was able to copy most of the files off it in about half an hour.</p>

    <p>I recall seeing a folder with my name on it during my initial look through I don't see it in my archive. I will have to go back in.</p>
