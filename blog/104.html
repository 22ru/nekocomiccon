    <p>Seattle haul?!? <a href="https://kohidate.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">kohi</a> and i (and both of our bfs) went to seattle for some shopping! we ditched the boys for most of the trip (or did they ditch us?)</p>

    <img src="../img/HAT09094.jpg" />

    <ul>
        <li>papo d'anjo skirt $9.97</li>
        <p>I was shocked at how nicely this was made! it's 100% wool and lined. found at goodwill university district</p>
        <li>another watercolor palette $1.75</li>
        <p>there is absolutely no reason for me to need more than 2.</p>
        <li>rotom dex toy $3.50</li>
        <p>i really wanted a little rotom dex and i was terrified that it was blind box, but each pokemon had a different box so i was confident enough to buy it. it's hollow but now i have a doll sized rotodex</p>
        <li>6 blick brand soft pastels $3.50 each</li>
        <p>these 6 sticks probably cost twice as much as the whole box i was given when i was 10</p>
        <li>dried flower bookmark $0</li>
        <p>free with purchase of book. i didnt purchase a book...</p>
        <li>small clippies $1.75</li>
        <p>I've seen these tiny clips in doll sewing videos and i couldnt for the life of me figure out where they were getting them or what they were actually for</p>
        <li>youkai watch (JP) $7</li>
        <p>I paid using Ryan's store credit. pink gorilla is not particularly good at fraud detection. thanks Ryan!</p>
        <li>Breaking Benjamin - Saturate $.25</li>
        <p>i made my friend buy it for me because i had no quarters. everyone proceeded to make fun of me later so i guess i paid in laughs</p>
        <li>3 Doors Down - Away From the Sun $.25</li>
    </ul>

    <p>driving into u district, i spotted a sign for an <a href="https://artistcraftsman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">art supply store</a> UNDER petco?! idk how ive never noticed it before. i used to live in this neighborhood and never thought twice about it. it was even the petco i bought 3 of my marimo at! we did our rounds of the ave and then checked it out. it was HUGE and they had so much stuff!! </p>

    <p>but, kohi and I were all hyped up to go to blick. so we held out at the art supply store in the university district. it was a huge mistake! the one in the u district was so much bigger even though it was slightly over blick's online prices. we got to blick 30 minutes before closing. i scrambled to search out gouache paints and pastels while kohi picked out alcohol markers. they didnt actually have any of the items i has picked out earlier online and the gouache singles were out of my price range. i only ended up getting pastel singles because of it. i guess i'll just stick with my $5 gouache set for now. oh well.</p>

    <p>i did get to go back to kinokuniya as well but i panicked and wasn't able to pick anything else out. the UW bookstore actually had a fountain pen section as well as way more art supplies than i expected. they had the rose scented ink which was very tempting...</p>

    <p>and check out ryan's book haul!</p>
