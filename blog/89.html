    <p>i saw a few snowflakes yesterday. thought no biggie. woke up to a foot or so of snow. cmon i thought it was APRIL. oh well. ill put the christmas tree back up</p>

    <p>through a combined effort of <a href="https://pompon.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pompon</a> and I, a new super dollfie webring now exists! let me know if you want to be a member. we are just a little lonely</p>

    <p>after how many weeks, i finally finished handsewing hina's juban. i would like to announce my retirement from handsewing. I was super close to running out of pink thread. i just barely made it!</p>

    <p>here's some interesting confessions from the DoA confession thread:</p>

    <p class="quote">"I dont like putting a girl doll next to my boys.. <br />I dont want my boys to be by a beautiful girl so they dont see how old and ugly I am. <br />whoooo that is stupid in written words but atleast they love me"</p>

    <p class="quote">"I get secretly offended when people say they hate doll breasts because they look fake. Since I have fake boobies myself and I love them."</p>

    <p class="quote">"I once bought a Migidoll Ell head and I forgot his existence since the time I received him, forgetting about his existence for about, a year or two? While I whined all the time 'Oh I want Migidoll Ell soooo bad!'"</p>

    <p>once in a while i see people accusing (rightfully or unrightfully) others of stealing their html/css. when will this happen to me? never because my entire site is a javascript mess. good luck noobs. but actually good luck because i dont care if you take my code, images, etc. if you can understand it and make it work, you deserve it. the old web was mostly stolen anyway.</p>
