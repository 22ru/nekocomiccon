	<h2>IT IS Spring!!!!</h2>
	<h4 class="date">March 23, 2022</h4>

    <p>it's spring! its spring! its overwhelmingly spring!!</p>

    <p>i saw a squirrel with something in its mouth sitting on the sidewalk. i walked a little closer and it seemed to be a wiggling baby squirrel and hopefully not a snack? i cant tell if it was a good or bad omen but i did see a baby animal today either way.</p>

    <p>and then i saw a double rainbow! it was so pretty ;u; what a good start to my favorite season</p>

    <p>i ordered a half gallon of texas pete last night. will i regret it? im not sure. its a little wild to think that in a few days i will have a ridiculous amount of my favorite hot sauce. i cant find it anywhere though. im so desperate...</p>

    <p>i got my volks news 95 too!! its so fun to look at and even if i cant own the items i can look at them all i want! I really like the DWC2020 winner <a href="https://dollfie.ec.volks.co.jp/category/D_FASHION/4518992437972.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strawberry Kimono Maiden</a> but its also like a ton of money and i think i can bootleg something similar to it for minimal money. theres some other items i need to think about too..</p>

    <p>princess sapphire is very very cute. knight sapphire is cute, but princess sapphire is incredibly cute so it must be the color combo or something. i ordered a pair of lucia's eyes that i've been watching for a while to create "princess sapphire"! the eyes are the same color but 18mm instead of 20mm. i would like to try a pair of 20s in her but i dont own any. i never really expected to like brown eyes either but they look really cute in her. i hope this will prevent me from deciding to enter for her if she gets a volksUSA lottery. </p>

    <p>i finished my earring holder! my giant *ss squid hoops dont fit on it very well though. its really nice to see them all instead of them being in a pile.</p>

    <p>i painted 3 options for my little ribbon frame. quatchi, button, and a furby because i couldn't come up with anything better. the more i look at the furb the more derpy he gets! they're too big for the frame i got today so i suppose ill have to draw or paint something else for that one. </p>
