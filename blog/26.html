	<p>i came home and found a lovely komainu in my home!! ryan wont tell me where he found it but i love him!</p>

	<img src="../img/HAT03808.jpg" />
	<p>i was at a yard sale that promised "designer" purses and found this basket. so i peeked inside and saw 2 pairs of geta and a yukata. i asked how much it was and she said $5. sold.</p>

	<p>i didnt really get a good look inside until i got back. i didnt really care what else was in there in the moment because i'm willing to spend $5 on a yukata.</p>

	<p>the attempt at a name is supposed to be "richelle". one of the notes written by the woman talks about how she couldn't eat the rice and seaweed she was served for breakfast so her hosts made her pizza instead.</p>
