	<p>someone with good taste donated recently because goat dam. i went a little nuts but im throwing out all the cd and dvd cases anyway. so many 80s CDs and a movie lover must have died because there were a ton of great DVDs (that we already have). i found a box of CDs and was like "oh H*CK yes" </p>

	</ul>

	<p>my disc drive can read like 50% of CDs for some reason. it makes ripping them a terrible pain.</p>

	<p>we walked past the weed store and it was awfully busy. its wednesday so i asked why?? why is everyone getting high on wednesday?? it is an easy to answer question.</p>

	<p>are there like any lampworkers/glassblowers around who aren't making bongs? why isnt anyone making glass pens or doll eyes? i dont want a bong!!!! it would be nice to support american artists who do beautiful work but there doesnt seem to be anyone around</p>

	<p>on that note, i need to check if i've taken photos to make a chihuly shrine.</p>
