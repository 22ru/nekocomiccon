    <p>I must share with you the worst experience of my life today.</p>

    <p>I was preparing a Very Delicious Morning Latte this morning. I finished the coffee parts as well as Ryan's milk. I delivered his latte to him.</p>

    <p>I got my milk ready for the big angry swirl, and saw something move to my side. I looked over and found a spider running laps around the rim of my filled coffee cup.</p>

    <p>As any sane person would do, I started screaming!!! Ryan did not come quick enough to help me with any ideas with what to do about this enthused and athletic spider.</p>

    <p>And just like that, he jumped into my coffee.</p>

    <p>Ryan pulled the spider out and offered to trade me for his partially sipped latte. Thank you Ryan...</p>

    <p>He has informed me he is able to shoot webs from his hands now.</p>
