	<h2>Diana will always be the queen in our hearts</h2>

    <p>While cleaning, I discovered my first copy of Photoshop! It's called IBM Magic Canvas. I don't see any videos about it on youtube. Was I the only one?? We have a ton of educational "games" that I can't remember playing. I do remember all the Humongous games and HOW MANY BUGS IN A BOX.</p>


    <p>I ventured out into the "big" city with my mom. I never realized how small the big cities out here are until a few years ago. They're really nothing compared to any city in the Seattle area.</p>

    <p>i mostly only found movies at the goodwills we stopped by. I've been looking for Drive ever since I found out Real Human Bean was from a movie.</p>

    <p>I discovered an autistic art supply store while we were out! I bought a pentel brush pen, a rose sakura pigma brush pen, brush cleaner, blue .5mm lead refills, and a white POSCA marker.</p>

    <p>I've been wanting a brush pen for a while and my fountain pen ink in daiso pen experiment was very messy and didnt work well. maybe my daiso brush pen was just too leaky for this purpose.</p>

    <p>they had a (full!) posca display but no copic display. I tried the spectrum AD markers but I couldnt get them to blend so I skipped buying any. they even had gouache singles! I'm still too cheap to buy them ;_;</p>

    <p>I've now been to hobby lobby, joanns, a smaller craft store, and michaels without wanting to buy anything. my pickiness is saving money!</p>

    <p>I found a few more CDs. All $1 each. Just imagine the beautiful cover art!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wang Chung - Points on the Curve</li>
        <p>I'm nervous about the scratches on this one but I want more Wang Chung and I NEVER see them</p>
        <li>Men at Work - Business as Usual</li>
        <p>The greatest hits album was very fun to listen to so I'm buying more.</p>
        <li>Three Doors Down - The Better Life</li>
        <li>Goo Goo Dolls - A Boy Named Goo</li>
        <li>Simple Plan - No Pad, No Helmet... Just Balls</li>
        <p>Wow nice blink-182 album name guys</p>
        <li>Howard Jones - Cross that Line</li>
        <p>I was really hoping to find earlier albums but this one is still in the 80s so I'll try it. I was not so into his 1992 album.</p>
        <li>52mm Sigma lens cap $.50</li>
    </ul>
