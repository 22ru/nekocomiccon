    <p>I forgot I took Hina out to tour The Grounds on Hinamatsuri for photos!! I didn't forget her I just forgot to look at them.</p>

    <p>I'm not sure how I feel about the blue eye. I don't have access to the green one right now, but I think I want to go back to it. I think this blue plus green would be the best odd eye combo, but tea rose is the prettiest brown ever and I should have just kept her with both browns to start with.</p>
