    <p>I started Xenoblade 3 on release in like July, and I finished the story right after Christmas at 121:10, but I have been continuing to play it until I was at a good place to start a new game +. I finished every quest I could find, all my heroes are ascended, and my weapons are upgraded. I can't believe it took me 142 hours for ONE playthrough. It's a long game!</p>

    <img src="../img/memes/xenoblade3.jpg" title="this took forever to make because I used gimp"/>

    <p>I took physical notes! So much that my pen even died. I'm not quite sure what "corrugated farbler gyroid" means, but I'm glad I wrote them because it took me so long to finish this game. New idea: the game ends immediately after 3 months pass from starting.</p>

    <p>If you don't like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>walking 10 steps to another cutscene</li>
        <li>cute boys</li>
        <li>convoluted storylines</li>
        <li>cutscenes that has nothing to do with the boss battle</li>
        <li>cute boys</li>
        <li>1 hour cutscene marathons</li>
    </ul>
    <p>you probably shouldn't play Xenoblade anything.</p>

    <h3>Things I liked about Xenoblade 3:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>that glitch where Taion and Noah are standing in the same spot and Taion is bent over</li>
        <li>EVERY party member is in a pairing</li>
        <li>Lanz</li>
        <p>best boy</p>
        <li>I don't think you can get locked out of any sidequests.</li>
        <li>No penalty for dying</li>
        <li>decently faithful translation from what I could hear</li>
        <p>Some names were changed and terms E rated, but they didn't modify the story. This was not the Xenoblade 2 disaster.</p>
        <li>Zeon's tiny wings that look like doggie ears</li>
        <li>so many throwbacks to 1 and 2</li>
        <li>nopon</li>
        <li>improved cinematography</li>
        <li>menus look current gen</li>
        <li>relationships that result in baby</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ptoGIgvpfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">li garte prison camp</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The story in this one is on par with 2, but I feel like 2 had a decent explanation and a more shocking twist. I liked all the party members! Each of them got their own backstories and personalities. Noah and Mio go the deepest of course.</p>

    <p>The world is open, but still feels more linear than the last 2 games. You're mostly only locked out by level of the enemies in the area.</p>

    <h3>Things I didn't like about Xenoblade 3:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>uh wait how does this work??</li>
        <p>They forgot to explain a couple very important details that don't make sense with prior knowledge from the last game.</p>
        <li>even my coworkers knew the spoilers???</li>
        <p>I once had to cover my ears and run away</p>
        <li>wait seriously why are there 2?? WHY DIDNT THIS GET EXPLAINED I'm almost doubting they worked all the details out</li>
        <li>they are all dressed like zoomers.</li>
        <li>wasn't obvious on how to unlock all the quests</li>
        <p>You need to have a certain hero in your party to be able to see the ? on the map or trigger the quest</p>
        <li>battles are too busy</li>
        <p>you have 6 permanent party members plus 1 extra hero. there's way too much going on!</p>
        <li>too many robots</li>
        <li>one character is 15 years older than her daughter.</li>
        <li>DLC</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySXkGaMX2k4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menu music</a></li>
        <p>I like the song a lot but its opening is far too bold to hear every time you open the menu especially when it restarts if you hit the wrong menu.</p>
        <li>I'm going to sound like an idiot if anyone asks me to say "moebius" メビウス</li>
        <li>not fully open world</li>
        <p>Some chests were locked, even if you were strong enough to clear the enemy around them. Other areas are not accessible until you hit a point in the plot and then SUDDENLY the landscape changes and it's accessible.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>In Xenoblade 2, I came out feeling really confused. After playing Torna and then replaying 2, I got really into it. I don't know if playing 3 again will resolve confusion or if they plan to make me play $30 for an explanation with the expansion pass.</p>

    <h3>Other notes:</h3>
    <p>Somewhere in the promotional interviews, someone on the team claimed there was 4x more area to explore than the last games. They forgot to mention a HUGE chunk of the area is empty water space. The game is still huge though.</p>

    <p>I highly recommend playing both 1 and 2 before this game. It's not necessary but it references those games a lot, much more than you need to play 1 before 2.</p>

    <p>Small glitches were encountered. None were game breaking other than one. Twice, a unique beast decided he was no longer fighting me at the end of the battle and walked off. Empty colonies still have the bustling city background noise. The "choose your side" battle noises are NOT X direction sensitive and you can hear them from super high up if your X, Y location is near. Biggest glitch was a total crash where I thanked kami-sama for autosaves.</p>

    <p>Hit L and R at the same time to take a clean screenshot!</p>

    <p>I'm pretty sure they never tell you that you can only set ONE map marker per region. I marked a whole bunch before realizing this.</p>

    <p>The ocean animation made me seasick. Too realistic?</p>

    <p>"It stops being our TV when you put naked boys on it." -Ryan</p>

    <p>I felt like there was influence from Nier: Automata. Chain attacks definitely had infulence from Persona 5 all out attacks.  The new hero animation reminds me of Smash announcements.</p>

    <p>The amiibo scanning loading animation is fake and you can remove the amiibo when it starts.</p>

    <p>Many girls get their term markers in ecchi sketchy places such as boob and inner thigh.</p>

    <p>This game had modifier buttons that changed the menus when held. IDK if I just haven't played a game with this but it's a first for me!</p>
