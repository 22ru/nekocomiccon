	<p>Back on the 10th, my friends <a href="https://kohidate.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohi</a>, AWL420, and Kappa came out to hang out with us! Kohi told us there was going to be northern lights that night. I kinda didn't believe her, but it was true.</p>

	<p>We went outside in the middle of nowhere with very little light pollution. No one saw more than a few boring smudges in the sky. When the cameras came out, everything changed. My aiPhone wasn't able to get any interesting shots, but everyone else has some weird samsung tech that got them some decent photos.</p>

	<p>I didn't edit any of these photos, only resized. In photos taken in the same spot directly after another, it was pretty clear these dudes were moving and changing quickly.</p>

	<p>I wish I had brought my tripod, but I didn't expect to see this at all! Warn me next time :3</p>

	<p>If I had put down my camera and adjusted my eyes, I may have been able to see all of this, but instead I just took a lot of photos. It was a lot of fun!</p>

	<p>There's a strange circular artifact that appears near the center of all these photos. I still haven't checked to see if it's my lens or my sensor ;_;</p>

	<p>I received an overwhelming number of emails asking me for proof of the last Saturn haul! Okay guys!! Here it is!</p>
