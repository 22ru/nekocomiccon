	<p>I swear I am the busiest NEET alive! How am I so busy!!!!</p>

	<p>Ryan and I made the mad dash back to the distant storage unit and retrieved a bunch of things. One of these things is my Cintiq 16, which I did not bring previously because my laptop was incapable of doing much of anything.</p>

	<p>I spent a few more hours optimizing my Linux Drawing Experience, as always, and now it's mostly back up and running, thanks to help from <a href="https://oldoldcool.cool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linus</a>.</p>

	<p>It was a very lovely spring day, so I took a walk around The Grounds with my Seikanon 28mm. I have NOT been able to get the aperture to stop down no matter what I try. This lens also feels cheaper than my Canon brand lenses. There doesn't seem to be any damage on it so I'm surprised it's broken.</p>

	<p>28mm f/2.8 is very similar to the 26mm f/1.8 that my iPhone XS claims it has. I took some comparison shots. I tried to position the sensors in the same place for each set. iPhone camera on right.</p>

	<p>I'm not sure there's much of an advantage of using this lens over using my phone, but the DOF is much shallower with close ups.</p>

	<p>Haul time!!! I got really lucky in the CD department the other day.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>pink ultrapro card sleeves $1.99</li>
		<li>30 Seconds to Mars - A Beautiful Lie $3</li>
		<p>Ryan scouted this as something up my alley, but I had no idea what it sounded like. <a href="https://oldoldcool.cool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linus</a> said it was a good album so I trusted his judgement. Ryan says Jared Leto was the guy getting his a*s destroyed in Patrick Bateman's apartment so that's a good start.</p>

		<li>Blaqk Audio - Bright Black Heaven $3</li>
		<p>I love AFI. I love electrotunes. This is perfect!!!</p>
