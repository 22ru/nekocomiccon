    <p>I hit the thrift store for the first time in a little while. I didn't find much!</p>

    <img src="../img/LOL01062.jpg" />

    <ul>
        <li>Moby - Play $1</li>
        <p>Ryan wanted it. Not really sure who he is.</p>
        <li>Neewer reflector $1.99</li>
        <p>This thing is HUGE and I already hit myself in the face with it.</p>
        <li>loew-cornell 3/4" wash brush $.10</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I totally fell down the wrong rabbit hole. I was thinking I should memorize Tokio Hotel's Durch den Monsun since I know baby german and it would be fun at karaoke parties with my dolls. I even have a camrip video I took of the music video on TV from 2007. Surely I had discovered jrock by then right? Anyway, still groundbreaking to lil me.</p>

    <p>So I listen to the English verison, then the German version. They are BABIES in the 2005 original! Holy carp!! CHILDREN! Yet, at 16, I wouldn't really expect his voice to still be so high. I guess it's possible. The 2007 English version is a bit lower, but his voice is still very high. He should have been 18 by then which is strange. So I use my big brain and decide the best possible version would be the German lyrics recorded 2007 at the time of the English release. He can still hit high notes, even if not as high as the original, but he can go lower in the final chorus. I think the drop there really adds to the song.</p>

    <p>I started thinking, what does this guy look like now?? He should be well into adulthood by now since he's a few years older than me. Don't tell me he still has the same hair.</p>

    <p>I discovered our dear tiny teenage Bill Kaulitz now has an onlyfans. What exactly is on this onlyfans... i dont know... Do I want to know? I don't think so. I'm not sure I wanted to know. And I'm sorry for telling you.</p>

    <p>There is also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWvbtxDlDoA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 version</a> of Durch den Monsun. It's very modern. And a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLieMJGWA1E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese version</a> with a different sound and a really pathetic translation that is still mostly in German. Nice try, record label.</p>
