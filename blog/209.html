        listening: Gackt - Moon
	</div>
	<h4 class="date">June 6, 2024</h4>


	<p>I typed in the item number on my invoice for the Gackt record I bought. They must have made a mistake right??</p>

	<p>The listing said did indeed say it was a CD. I almost started writing a message to them about the mistake. First I googled the album name and saw wikipedia referred to the album as a record.</p>

    <p>That was suspicious since this is a 2002 album and surely was not released only as a record. I went to ebay to look at listings.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>IT'S A CD</p>

    <p>I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS</p>

    <p>The booklet is CALENDAR SIZED. THERE'S A POSTER!!!!!</p>

    <p>I am going insane. This is the coolest CD packaging I have ever seen.</p>

    <p>Also I took a new photo please enjoy.</p>
