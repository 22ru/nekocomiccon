	<p>Big news everyone! I'm considering playing a game in February! Can you believe it? At this rate, I may finish it by February 2026!</p>

	<p>A big package came and Ryan and I got to open some more Christmas presents! I got some true cuties~</p>

	<p>This hanging Nina is very special! Back when I lived in Seattle circa 2015, one of my Touhou House friends had pulled Nina from a blind box. As an adult male, he was completely uninterested in her and either let me buy her off him or gave her to me.</p>

	<p>I can't remember if Nina was my favorite IMAS CG character yet, but I had her hanging off my purse for a long time. She got pretty damaged from it and Ryan started calling her Nino.</p>

	<p>One day I decided to go to Bellevue to visit Pink Gorilla for probably the first and last time before that location closed. While in Bellevue outside of Pink Gorilla, I noticed my Precious Nino was gone.</p>

	<p>I searched everywhere I could, but I had traveled quite a distance by public transportation so there wasn't much hope. I was very upset my little Nino was gone forever ;_____;</p>

	<p>Now after all this time, my little 2の is back!! I can't believe it!!! She will be protected this time. I won't lose her again.</p>

	<p>Here's the full Christmas haul! Ryan got some big girls~</p>

	<p>My favorite thing about pumpkins is that little animals will come by to munch them. I put my fall pumpkins outside a while ago and it didn't look like they were getting any attention. Upon closer inspection...</p>
