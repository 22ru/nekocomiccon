	<p>Ryan and friends and I visited downtown Seattle for a day trip~ It's always fun, but Seattle was nasty as usual.</p>

	<p>Notable sightings: a large pile of poop, more poop I don't want to remember, an emaciated man in his 20s stripping down to his undies at a bus stop, Cody of Pink Gorilla live streaming working, "Democracy Vouchers" advertised on the sides of buses, "buy art not fentanyl" sticker, plenty of people hunched over</p>

	<p>I actually looked through the CDs this time at Al's. I can't recall if I've ever done this before. I always assumed their prices were above what I was willing to pay. I was a little impressed that their 99 cent stacks were somewhat quality controlled. They had Alphaville's Forever Young for $30 and a signed copy of Skold vs KMFDM for $90. Glad I already have both of those. They're both good! AWL420 bought a YMO record that I spotted for him.</p>

	<p>I peeled off the stickers on Blues Traveler and found out this CD has been at Al's for quite a while.</p>

	<p>Things I did not find: 1/3 scale Daiso itabags, Doruoji, Copic replacement brush nibs</p>

	<p>And from my favorite store, Gamer's Tavern, and just a little bit from goodwill:</p>

	<p>I went and bought my games at the Tavern on Friday and then came back on Saturday to a 15% off sale. sigh......</p>

	<p>I spent a LOT of time looking through piles of cards looking for Adaman. Does he not exist??? Give me Adaman!!</p>

	<p>I know I didn't like Piers originally, but I can no longer understand why no one likes Piers! I saw a whole bunch of his cards and had no one to buy them for. Piers is a good boy.</p>

	<p>And with this, I have completed my No More Heroes collection. Pink Gorilla man told me that Travis Strikes Back was a great co-op game, but there's nothing I hate more than playing video games with someone else.</p>
