    <p>Hina arrived 2 years ago today! My most blessed girl! I forgot her birthday last year... oops. I took extra precautions for this year.</p>

    <p>We've had so many fun memories together! We've gone clubbing, watched movies, played games, went to a Marilyn Manson concert, gone on many dates. I couldn't ask for a better doll!!! She's perfect~ Here's to another year of being 17 together!</p>
