	<p>Hello, my dudes and dudettes....</p>

	<p>I finally finishing up the struggle of updating to debian 12. It's been a rough journey... I had a lot of trouble getting my firefox ramdisk initialization script to run. I was seeing logs of it existing but when I had terminal access after boot, it was gone. I asked a Linux Expert friend why the heck that would happen. He asked me what output I got from a command, so I turned on my computer and, most embarrassingly, the ramdisk showed up before doing anything.</p>

	<p>I got firefox using it, but for some reason if I use rsync and restart my computer, firefox will no longer save tabs and returns to the time I used rsync the first time. Mysteries are still afoot...</p>

	<p>I gave up on doing it myself and tried profile-sync-daemon. I really didn't think this needed more than a couple lines of scripting, but I guess I was wrong. At least my SSD isn't being destroyed anymore and my computer is functional...</p>

	<p>I modified chiizukeiki and went to go modify the udev rule since the drivers for the joycon changed. I could NOT make a udev rule that would make a symlink for the joycon! I was so frustrated! After a few days of trying, I noticed udevadm test wasn't looking at the file I made. I mistyped my instructions to myself and created the file in the wrong folder. ;_; chiizukeiki should be good enough to use with my tablet now. I'm not sure it'll be a useful program to anyone else due to drivers possibly differing between distros. There's a few messy things in the code I'd like to clean up. It's lagging unlike the previous iteration and needs a couple more bugs removed that appeared.</p>

	<p>I accidentally clicked on  <a href="https://www.suruga-ya.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suruga-ya</a> the other day and found they were doing another free shipping event. It seems like they do they pretty often, but I really felt the need to order!!! I went a little nuts.</p>

	<p>There were a few things that I wasn't sure was going to be worth buying, but they were really pretty cheap with the exchange rate, so I took the risk. I'll give you a rating on them! I also grabbed some Western CDs that are a little difficult to find in a thrift store. And some Gackt CDs. Couldn't afford to stock up on Malice Mizer, as much as I wanted to.</p>

	<p>Shipping was fast. Box is big. Verona for scale. Ordered May 28th, arrived June 5th. 1 USD = 150.28 JPY was the Paypal exchange rate that day, for reference. The entire order came out cents below $200 USD. I managed to make an account under my email with a typo and couldn't access the order info. Suruga-ya did not help with this when I asked and their contact page is broken and can't accept newlines. Customer service mess. Luckily an order list came in the box, so I was able to confirm everything I ordered was included.</p>

	<p>I opened it up to "oh my god I have made such a mistake!!!" What will my mother think of me?! Someone so anti vinyl.... buying a record.... I can't believe I've done this!!!</p>

	<p>Between my computer struggles and boy drawings, I made Hina a dress for Gingham Girl Summer. I don't think I own any gingham for myself. It's such a cute pattern, but I only see it rarely in vintage clothes.</p>

	<p>My buddy Flan asked me what burando I wanted from Laforet. As usual, I have no ability to make any decision, but I found out about gouk雅. I love wa lolita!!! So cute~~ Wait are there any cowboy lolitas yet?? Looking at Wunderwelt makes me want to throw away all my boring clothes and just wear cute ones. Maybe next life I can be cute!</p>

	<p>I was at the used bookstore with Ryan and found a Matsuri Hino one shot manga. I don't like her writing, so I didn't buy it, but there was a second one shot at the end of the book called "Spring Cherry Blossoms A Small Incident at Sakuradaya, Meiji Era". The main man is a KIMONO COWBOY. I can't believe my eyes!!! The world is blessed.</p>
