	<p>We stopped by our favorite store, Gamer's Tavern, and found out the owner was selling the games portion of his store! Possibly devastating...</p>

	<p>Gamer's Tavern actually has really decent pricing and does get interesting stuff in. I hope the new owner will be just as cool as the current!</p>

	<p>While at Gamer's Tavern, I found a new boy on a model kit with <a href="https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/7564815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this stunning illustration</a> on it! His name is Max Jenius and he looks like Мурат Насыров. What more could you want in a fictional man?!</p>

	<p>And for a tiny thrift haul:</p>

	<p>Due to increased luck from wearing my Hina shirt today, I found a perfect chair for Hina for $5 at Goodwill~</p>

	<p>Her heels just barely float above the ground. I wonder how the boys will fit in it.</p>

	<p>I took my spresso machine apart after discovering a steam leak (HOT HOT HOT OUCHIE) and found water creeping out of the connection between the heating element and the boiler. ;_;</p>

	<p>I'm very unexcited to take the entire boiler out and confirm and replace the o-rings in it. We had just found another Starbucks Barista less than a month ago in Goodwill for $40 with a portafilter. I decided against it, not knowing how much a dang portafilter costs or that I would have to do a tedious repair so soon.</p>
