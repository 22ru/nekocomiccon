	<p>i went back to the thrift store from yesterday since i didnt get to check any of the CDs. i looked through every CD and found a bunch i thought ryan may be interested in but he wasnt interested in any!! its okay i found 2 i want</p>

	<p>also went to the consignment shop. had a good time looking around but didnt get anything (success!?)</p>

	<p>stopped by the dollar store on the way back and found a bunch of 3DS accessories. ive been looking for these d*nged cart cases forever but wasnt willing to spend $8 on a bunch of bootlegs. dollar tree really came through for me this time!</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Lejun red belt $1.50</li>
		<p>Glove leather (???) and fits my waist (rare). i was really looking for one of these!</p>

		<li>Staind Break the Cycle $1.00</li>
		<p>poor ryan is going to have to listen to this from the other room. im very excited to sing this one.</p>

		<li>Phil Collins No Jacket Required $1.00</li>
		<p>I was thinking about making a ACAB ABACAB joke but I'll keep it to myself. I left "Testify" because i dont know any of the songs on it.</p>

		<li>PowerA 3DS case $1</li>
		<li>PowerA 3DS cart case $1 each</li>
		<p>16 carts per case. i have a lot of DS games... Ryan's getting at least one of these if not 2</p>

	</ol>

	<p>i slapped the LV strap on my fake hermes and wore it like that today even though the leather doesnt match. i'm not a huge fan of handbags to be honest. id much rather use a backpack or a crossbody bag. i carry too much cr*p around</p>

	<p>i had rio sitting out with me for a few days and now liam's been out with me for a while. he's such a good looking boy! i wish i had a good wig for him but its weird to imagine a Ryu with a fiber wig and not mohair...</p>

	<p>it's hard to believe this mold is discontinued. it's such a banger!! i guess it had been produced since 2006 though so maybe the casting mold wore out? im glad i have one</p>
