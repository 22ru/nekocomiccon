	<p>Here's Ryan's omiyage for me!</p>

	<p>Peach-Pit did the art this year. There's chibi versions of the mascots as well within the AX guidebook. Very cute!! I wish more cons had the funds to commission mangaka for their yearly promo art. Ryan brought me a paper pad from the Ritz Carlton. This is the best paper for paper memes!</p>

	<p>In his pictures, there was a lot of 10+ year old anime. Are the Japanese running out of ideas too?? At least I recognized a lot. Madoka is even on the lanyard! I was very happy to see the <a href="https://idolmaster-official.jp/lp/i_make_impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IM@S x Pacman 45th collab</a>! I don't think there's a new set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AdZKFpCceo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bangers</a> coming though ;_; I am really happy to see the original girls again. They've become so neglected.</p>

	<p>Ryan did not see Hina at Anime Expo! He looked very hard for her. He did see <a href="https://x.com/Ginko_02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ginko</a> and got a signed "Jank Boteko" from him?? He got a piggie from Ginko for me. I'm really sad I didn't get a Jank Boteko though...</p>
