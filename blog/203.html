	<p>I didn't bring enough coins! Small bills and coins are crucial to getting the best deal.</p>

	<p>It always sucks to find out parents are selling their children's items without permission, but their loss is my gain. Parents have no idea what the value of any item is and won't look it up. This is lucky for me!</p>
