	<h2>久しぶり!</h2>
	<h4 class="date">July 27, 2023</h4>

	<p>It's been a while since my last blog post huh?? They haven't been able to kill me yet!</p>

	<p>Mostly what I've been up to is singing old Sonny Moore/Skrillex songs. I'm not good at it yet but I'm getting lots of practice in to the dismay of everyone around me.</p>

	<p>Very blessed <a href="https://zucchini.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hors</a> sent me another package full of wonderful gifts! I love her ;A; The Sanrio x Texas merch is the best merch I've ever seen in my life. She even drew me a Rio!!</p>

	<p>My Kuru Toga pipe slide seems to have kicked it. Rest in Peace, my favorite pencil. Will be missed greatly. I can't remember when I got it, but it was after I got my Rilakkuma one in 2018.</p>

	<p>I finished Furuba and I loved it!! I'm gonna have to buy the manga... it was so good! I speedran all the books I had and ran back to the library to get the rest. I'm not so sure about one of the twists and I think the series would have been better without it. Maybe it would have been more exciting in the past.</p>

	<p>I've taken so many dollfoto since the last blog post. Here's a few samplings as advertisements to go to their gallery pages:</p>

	<p>I managed to sew Rio a kimono, Cheby a haori and a shirt, and Liam some shorts out of Ryan's old shorts. It was a sewing marathon for a few days! I'm a lot happier with Rio now. He's been neglected for years, but he's starting to look a lot better. I still need to buy him a nicer pair of eyes.</p>

	<p>And now... 3 (THREE) shopping trips from the thrift store.</p>
