	<h2>merry christmas...</h2>
	<h4 class="date">April 16, 2022</h4>

    <p>i am not at sakuracon if you are looking for me. i cant be more disinterested in going to a convention that requires masks. i'll wait.</p>

    <p>it's been snowing off and on all week... i hope the flowers aren't all h*cked. it is currently snowing as i write this ;a;</p>

    <p>we got a nice day last week so we went on a walk to look at the flowers. the cherry blossoms were starting! idk if i want to take hina out or my DD again for them because honestly i'm terrified of dropping hina out of a tree.</p>

    <p>a new little store opened up downtown! i made ryan check it out with me. i was surprisingly pleased at what they offered! they have a few racks of loose leaf teas, a few little plants, bulk "natural" goods, and some locally made cr*p. I got 1oz of blue tea and 1oz of coconut assam. the blue tea is very fun because it turns purple with acid! unforunately all i have is vinegar and it makes it taste awful.</p>

    <p>the juban was flimsy as expected so i sewed a folded ribbon and piece of lace over it for a haneri. i finished a bight pink obi for her too. i was just going to handsew it but handsewing is miserable so i had my machine struggle through it. the needle became less misaligned as it warmed up.</p>

    <p>i've been having so much trouble with her kitsuke. i have some padding under it but it keeps twisting so i have it secured with a rubber band. her obi is still not flat though so i'll need to work on it more.</p>

    <p>her hands and heet shipped the other day, and the tracking says they should arrive today, but they haven't made it to my town so ill just hope for monday!</p>

    <p>yes i am that awful to put an animated png on my site. enjoy, nerds! i separated my volks info from the generic bjd guide and put it all in its own shrine. more than half of bjd lovers who speak english dont give a c*rp about volks anyway. but they should!</p>
