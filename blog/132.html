    <p>Hello... my friends and foes....</p>

    <img src="../img/LOL01062.jpg" />

    <p>Surely you have noticed my very cool microblog in development over the last few days. Do you like it? Do you hate it?! Well, you just have to go outside and scream into the sky and hope that I hear you. I will be listening.</p>

    <p>I am just a little generous so here it is: <a href="https://github.com/22ru/microblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the code</a>! Please use it to make your own! I hope to see many of these microblogs floating around.</p>

    <p>If you need extra help with CSS, take <a href="https://github.com/22ru/nekocomiccon/tree/master/microblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mine</a>. Edit it if you want... or not! RSS is pretty easy and I think you can handle it. It's more strict than HTML so if you are guilty of leaving tags open, please use caution.</p>
