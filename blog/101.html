	<h2>hat's apology post</h2>
	<h4 class="date">June 24, 2022</h4>

    <p>I promised you all, this very same month, that I wouldn't buy more pens. I walked into a store, saw a pen for $4, and bought it. I am so sorry.</p>

    <img src="../img/HAT08998.JPG" />

    <p>It's a pink Pilot Petit1. It was so cute, so small, so pink... The nib feels a lot cheaper than my kakuno. It feels scratchy and looks much closer to a shaped slab of stainless steel. I can't imagine my kakuno has an amazing nib either so this one must just not be impressive in the slightest. I plan to leave it in my purse and I'll fill it with lovely violet scented ink once I use up this (also cute) pink ink.</p>

    <p>It was relatively easy to pass up all the cool inks at the shop once I remembered they don't smell. I saw preppies and kawecos and lamys for the first time but none of them stood out terribly. the kawecos were much smaller and lighter than i had expected. I did want to get a refillable brush pen but I didn't have enough time to research. Maybe I'll get to go back or maybe i'll just use a waterbrush.</p>

    <p>none of these are from a thrift store but i'm documenting them anyway so i can remind myself what of junk i'm filling my house with</p>

    <ul>
        <li>winnie the pooh towel $3.25</li>
        <p>there was a cute one in front of it that ryan tried to convince me to buy, but i passed on it. then I saw this one of pooh and piglet snuggling and that was the end of that. i didnt even notice it was one of the higher priced items until later. oops...</p>
        <li>watercolor palette $1.75</li>
        <p>i have been looking for a palette for so long at the thrift store to no avail. i'm tempted to get another for the water color set i bought since I want to use this one with my gouaches. apparently youre not supposed to dry out your gouaches though.</p>
        <li>Toy Story Alien small bag $1.75</li>
        <p>ryan picked this out for his mom</p>
        <li>water brush $1.75</li>
        <p>it very well could end up being garbage quality. the water reservoir is very big on this one</p>
        <li>pilot petit1 $3.95</li>
    </ul>


    <p>And a thrift store haul, but not mine! most of it is for me though...</p>
