    <img src="../img/HAT05059.jpg" />

    <p>please look at this baby bun. so small so cute. absolutely made my day to look out the window and see him!</p>

    <img src="../img/HAT05066.jpg" />

    <p>i have no idea what these strange things are. i need to bring my close up filters out tomorrow for a closer pic</p>

    <p>i keep trying to get some better astrophotos. this is what i came up with last time i went out. i found an astro thread on /p/ so i skimmed through that and took their advice on increasing iso. maybe i went too high!</p>

    <p>you can maybe see some milky way smudgies in this one.</p>

    <p>a sadler teapot for $4! its incredibly reflective! I made a pot of tazo passion since it was in the pantry today to test it out. i put 2 bags in and boy that was a mistake! its too strong! incredibly strong!!</p>

    <p>i got some sugar free rootbeer a few days ago to sip in moderation and put it in the fridge and when i pulled it out today it was froze! i still havent gotten any of my root beer yet</p>

    <p>pokemon caaaards!!! i was at a consignment shop with ryan and i picked out all the cute cards at someones booth to show him. and he bought me almost all of them! the 4 in the bottom right corner are his. I picked out 2 of them and that was his tax for buying me some i guess! this booth was expensive compared to the card shop i visited in idaho, so i didnt want to get much but it didnt end up that way!</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/generations/H14.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this espurr</a> is my favorite. its so sweet!! I would like to imagine that if i had a pokemon it would be dressed up similarly. the flavor text is ♡! i didnt know about generations radiant collection but i need like all the cards in that set now. <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/generations/H12.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this gulpin</a> is such good buddies with his trainer ;a;</p>

    <p>This set of three (<a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/generations/H3.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1, </a>
    <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/generations/H4.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2, </a>
    <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/generations/H5.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>) with the charmander growing up with his trainer is also ;aaaaaaaa; so sweet!!!</p>

    <p>im gonna look for more of them. they are too dokidoki!!! they seem to be easy to pick out because of the charms in the upper left corner</p>
