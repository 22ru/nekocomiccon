    <p>remember the doll rocking chair from <a href="20.html">blog 20</a>?? i finally took it apart (it mostly just fell apart tbh) and picked off the glue, sanded the edges and used wood glue to put it back together!</p>

    <p>hopefully it'll stay together now. they must not have wood glue in "taiwan"</p>

    <p>i've been promising to make ryan arm covers for his little green armchair for like 2 years now and i finally did it today. I think they turned out okay and they do a good job of hiding the rips</p>

    <p>also pictured: liam in a pink wig. pity him.</p>

    <p>we stopped by the thrift store and walmart and ryan bought me some pokemon cards and we got spicy water. my only thrift store find was The Human League - Dare for $.99. i did not bring liam with me to the store, thanks for asking. i also had to master manual focus with my pinky</p>

    <p>omake: full moon</p>
