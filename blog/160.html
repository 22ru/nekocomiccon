    <p>I went out for hanami photos yesterday of Hina and looked for my Doll Hair Toothbrush. I couldn't find it so I only took the wide tooth comb. I haven't looked through those photos yet so please wait warmly.</p>

    <p>Higher priority is Sochi's birthday! So I looked for the dang toothbrush a little harder toda, gave up, and went without it.</p>

    <p>I'm glad I walked a similar path I did for the Cheby photos in <a href="158.html">blog 158</a> because toothbrushkun was sitting under a tree I stopped near!! Mystery solved!!</p>

    <p>I forgot how light minis are. They're very easy to hold with one hand! She's very loose though so I had a lot of trouble getting her to stand.</p>

    <p>Are you interested on what was on my SSD?? No??? okay!!! I had 200 GB of photos and 300 GB of music. The total was 600 GB. It didn't take very long to transfer at all! I'm very impressed!</p>

    <p>The mass exodus of my town has apparently not yet started. I'm very excited for it. Please, donate all your valuables!! I want them!</p>
