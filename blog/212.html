		writing: thrift hauls, again
	</div>
	<h4 class="date">July 5, 2024</h4>

	<p>I swear I have more interesting things to share!!! The hauls are getting out of hand again. Go read <a href="https://sylum.web.fc2.com/shrines/japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mima's Nippon review</a> instead!</p>

	<p>I got to go to a 4th of July festival. I put on my yukata and my mom said "no!!" but I wore it anyway and found a woman in a (also himawari) yukata at the festival. Shush, mother!!! I used my faux obi from my Tsukihi cosplay again. I really need to do something about my obi situation. It's not good.</p>

	<p>The world needs more summer festivals. They're a lot of fun! I hope I don't have to wait until next year for another.</p>
