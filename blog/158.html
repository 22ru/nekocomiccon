	<p>Ryan brought me lots of gifts from Sakuracon!! I got a plushie banana, Pokemon Arceus, Bilbo Baggins Pez dispenser, coffee beans, and the chance to rip 3 Smile.dk and Captain Jack greatest hits. Nice!!!</p>

	<p>While Ryan was at Sakuracon, I spent entirely too much time drawing boys and playing with dolls. Hina got a new jumper but I'm not happy with the look. The top was less fitted than I intended so she looks a big too top heavy. I'm planning on making a tight turtleneck to see if that helps.</p>

	<p>Fun fact: it fits on Cheby because the SD10 and SD13B torso are very similar in size.</p>

	<p>I haven't been to the thrift store in a while, but I got to make an uncomfortable visit today :| I got a few cricut carts for my mom though! Somehow she doesn't own all of them yet.</p>
