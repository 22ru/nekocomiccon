	<h2>My Thoughts on "ABJD"</h2>
	<h4 class="date">August 22, 2022</h4>

    <p>A decade ago, I thought the term ABJD was really silly. How many ball jointed dolls aren't Asian? There's Goodreau, Blue Blood Doll, and Batchix I suppose but the vast majority were Asian, so what's the point in adding it?</p>

    <p>There is now a point in adding the A. I was watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9MRvF9xtmc" target="_blank">video</a> of BJDC in Texas and it's full of strange looking Connie Lowe dolls. I don't really have a personal problem with Connie Lowe or her funky dolls existing, but these aren't even close to the same style of doll that was popular 10 years ago (and now!) A huge number of these dolls are just ball jointed resin versions of Western dolls.</p>

    <p>You can see at the end of <a href="https://youtu.be/kR4Pc4PKjws?t=955" target="_blank">this video</a> how the popular dolls have changed over the years. The convention started off as a Volks only convention and now it seems to be a celebration of Kaye Wiggs and Connie Lowe. The difference is no longer "I like Dollzone, you like Cerberus Project." The aesthetic has completely changed!</p>

    <p>I also found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU_wNxSdzvk" target="_blank">video</a> of Resin Rose in Oregon. There's some Blythes which definitely aren't BJDs, but lots of ABJD! I won't give up hope yet. Even rap1993 and maddybeardolls are closer to the ABJD aesthetic than Connie Lowe.</p>

    <p>I hit 10k photos on my camera! That's a big milestone right? It's 5 days away from being 2 years old! I thought my filenames were going to go into the next empty digit but it seems to have overflowed to 00001 instead. Why?? Why is that digit even there! I gotta figure something out before my older images on this site get overwritten...</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sculpey etch and pearl $.50</li>
        <li>Heat Erasable pens $.50</li>
        <li>Arizona gold trinket $.50</li>
        <p>Ryan needed it!</p>
        <li>Plaid clear acrylic sealer $.50</li>
        <p>This will stop pages with pastels from getting everything dirty right? maybe? I have no plans to try this on a doll (yet)</p>
        <li>Not pictured: Digimon Adventure Vol.2 DVD (sealed) $.50</li>
        <p>Another Ryan find. I didn't watch too much of this show when I was little but I like cowboy aerid.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>The high schooler cashier said each item was 50 cents but my total came out to $2.16. I even asked if she got everything and she was sure it was correct. Okay...</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Prismacolor watercolor 24 pack $.99</li>
        <p>I didn't plan to ever get watercolor pencils because they make faceups look grainy and awful, but there are more uses than faceups. The price and brand was right.</p>
        <li>The Natural Way to Draw $1.45</li>
        <li>The Man in the High Castle $.55</li>
        <p>I'm going to decide if Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is a one off hit or not.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>The DoA mods still haven't responded to me so I've decided to go doll rogue. What does this mean? All my dolls will be receiving bandanas. I will not make them smoke cigarettes because that's yucky. Also I'm getting a tattoo of Romantic Glance Williams on my thigh.</p>
