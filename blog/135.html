	<h2>Happy December!</h2>
	<h4 class="date">December 3, 2022</h4>

    <p>It's been very cold lately. The snow is reminding me that the world is covered in pee all year round and I just can't see it.</p>

    <p>I convinced Ryan to go to some sort of "craft fair" thing I saw advertised on a poster and we went! Surprisingly, the fair existed (unlike last time) and there was not a single MLM! Unfortunately they were selling nothing I wanted to purchase. Maybe next time.</p>

    <p>Ryan and I came up with a really awesome AC shrine for the release of New Horizons. Too bad it wasn't enough to summon a finished game. I have no hope for the next game. I'm not even sure I've bought any AC merch since the release of the game until today.</p>
