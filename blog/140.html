    <p>My new years resolution was completed successfully. I managed to wish my friend a happy birthday on time this year! Next year's resolution: wish him a happy birthday on time again!</p>

	<p>I hope next year will be filled with love, art, fun, and doll smoochies! I'll make it happen!</p>

    <p>And of course, what would a hat blog be without Proof of Shopping Addiction. No one has emailed asking me to post my grocery store haul yet.</p>

	<p>There was a sale for 50% off all hardcover books at the bookstore so I grabbed a couple things I've put off buying. Hopefully I have all the Nier artbooks now. Plus a gamestop and goodwill buys.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Final Fantasy Ultimania Archive Volume 2 $19.99</li>
		<p>Another one checked off my "to buy for Ryan" list. He has to wait for his birthday though!</p>
		<li>(The NEW) Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain $3</li>
		<p>I'll draw your right brain, nerd.</p>
		<li>NieR Art $13.99</li>
		<li>シオカラーズ amiibo $24.99</li>
		<p>I never thought they would rerelease these! They were super expensive in the past but I really wanted them for MSRP.</p>
		<li>Deathadder 2013 mouse $4.99</li>
		<p>the scrollwheel doesn't work so I need to return it. I hate how goodwill wants your ID and won't give you anything more than a gift card.</p>
		<li>Switch lite Lil' Linkie case $5.99</li>
		<p>Will my GBC + camera fit in it?? Surely something will fit in it.</p>
	</ul>

	<p>I got a chance to go back to the art store (and skipped Blick) and a few other stationery and art stores with my friend!! I had so much fun looking through all the things.</p>

	<p>I was so excited to buy my coworkers some pens!! I was going to buy each of them a Petit1... until there were no more Petit1s to be found ;_______; I tried to do my best to find them something anyway though. One of them specifically asked for a fountain pen and the other is a gel pen addict so I think my gifts will be okay. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Luka and Kinmoza clearfile</li>
		<p>Ryan wanted me to add his buys to the photo!</p>
		<li>winter berry spice tea $7.75</li>

		<li>small pink daruma $4.95</li>
		<li>watercolor pan set $3.59 *2</li>

		<li>Sarasa Vintage $1.95 *2</li>

		<li>doll bird hoods $1.75 *2</li>
		<li>clear plastic clips $1.75</li>
		<p>I needed more after the rainbow ones I got were awesome. No rainbow ones this time but this is fine. These are super useful in sewing.</p>
	</ul>

	<p>I was looking for a second shitajiki to buy, but I only saw disney ones. I was also looking for spare .2 copic multiliner nibs and also didn't see those! Hopefully my pen will work perfectly until I find them. I plan on keeping this pen for a Very long time so I don't mind having replacement parts.</p>

    <p>I noticed something good(?) while shopping. In one mall, there were 2 stores of locally made goods. I didn't go in to check if they were actually locally made, but I like to see that! The anime stores seemed to have legit figures for the first time ever. I did see many bootlegs but mostly of smaller merch. I also found out THEY FINALLY TRANSLATED THE PENGUINDRUM LNs??? Please tell me they're going to the Penguindrum collection 2 bluray. I love this series so much and I missed out on buying it because I had no money and now it's rare af.</p>
