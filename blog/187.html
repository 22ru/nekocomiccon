		<p>Ryan's</p>
		<li>NES/SNES/Genesis power adapter $10</li>
		<p>Ryan's</p>
	</ul>

	<p>I expected Ryan to try to convince me out of buying more ink, but he didn't so I bought more ink. I've been thinking about getting the rose scented ink for a while and didn't twice because I was worried about flying with it. I continued my search for foam erasers but was unsuccessful again. I haven't had much luck recently finding anything worth buying in Seattle in a while. Kinokuniya did not have doruoji or anything else for a reasonable price. I did fall for Kaworu on a clip strip in Uwajimaya and paid too much heh...</p>
