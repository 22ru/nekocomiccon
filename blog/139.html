    <p>I hope you are all having a good Christmas! We will be free from the incessant christmas music and movies in just a few hours, so stay strong! I have just barely survived this year. The only christmas movie I will agree to watch is Elf, which I did watch this year.</p>

    <p>I got way more gifts than I deserved this year! Somehow making an amazon wishlist worked out for the first time ever. I secretly hope the items on the list weren't purchased on Amazon but I'm sure they were ._.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Microfiber bed sheets</li>
        <li>olivewood cutting board</li>
        <li>a candle shaped like a chocolate bar</li>
        <p>THIS IS NOT CHOCOLATE! ALERT! ALERT!</p>
        <li>flowering tea</li>
        <li>FF7 Crisis Core</li>
        <p>I've never played this one before. This better have the JP audio!!!!! Gackt!!!!!!</p>
        <li>scour daddy</li>
        <li>whiskey salami</li>
        <li>bamboo cutting board</li>
        <p>Guess I should probably toss my melted plastic cutting board now...</p>
        <li>Cheese knives</li>        
        <li>Copic Multiliner SP .2</li>
        <li>refill ink</li>
        <p>I'm not entirely sure what this is for or why I got it. Is it supposed to work with the multiliner?</p>
        <li>pink hoodie</li>
        <p>Just an amazon brand but I like the shade of pink. It currently doesn't smell very good.</p>
        <li>snowman kitchen towel</li>
        <li>Marsilio Penguino</li>
        <p>Ryan saved him when he fell into a tealight and then traded for him in the white elephant game.</p>
        <li>Chinese calligraphy set</li>
        <li>flower shaped tea spoons</li>
        <li>Holbein irodori gouache summer</li>
        <p>I decided on this one over autumn even though autumn would be better for painting. This one had what I need for faceups. Maybe Praline won't end up blue next time haha</p>
        <li>Winnie the pooh planner sheets</li>
        <li>Midori 3 year journal</li>
        <p>After many discussions with <a href="https://zucchini.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hors</a>, I decided this one would be the best for me. I threw out the idea of another planner after realizing I have no plans and I like the idea of seeing what I wrote last year. The 5 year cover is much prettier but I want the space to write a little bit more. I want to make an extra cute cover for it though!</p>
        <li>lots of chocolate!!!!</li>
        <p>EXACTLY what I wanted</p>
    </ul>

    <p>Ryan got a comfy christmas cardigan which I am stealing as well as the all-in-one Death Note manga which I am also stealing. Light has his shirt open on the front so we all know this should be mine!</p>

    <p>We went to a consignment shop we visit a few times a year. I found some cute pokecards and Ryan also found a few! Mine are on the right and his are on the bottom.</p>

    <img src="../img/LOL01516.jpg" />

    <ul>
        <li>Goo Goo Dolls - Dizzy Up the Girl $1</li>
        <li>Nickleback - All the Right Reasons $1</li>
        <p>I think this was one of the ones I passed on for $3.</p>
        <li>Kare Kano 1 $1</li>
        <li>Kodocha 1-3, 5-7 $1 each</li>
        <p>I went back to the booth at the consignment shop I previously bought Kodocha 4 at and they had so many more this time!! My dumb b*tt didn't bother to update my manga page with which volume I already had but google saved my butt in finding the blog post on the fly.</p>
    </ul>
