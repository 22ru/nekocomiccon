	<p>What's up gamers?? I hope you've been keeping up on my <a href="../advent/2024/index.html">advent calendar</a> this year! There will be a quiz at the end of it, so stay studious!</p>

	<p>I've bought a few things so I gotta make another regular blog post to document them. I almost missed this first one but luckily I'm listening to an album from this haul that reminded me.</p>

	<p>I went back to Big Daiso again with Kohi and also got to visit the Half Price Books in Tacoma. I didn't know there was an HPB down there and now I want to go back and spend more hours there. Big Daiso restocked the toploader section since my last visit, so I grabbed 2 packs of sleeves.</p>

	<img src="../img/thrift/CIA02964.jpg">

	<ul>
		<li>Delerium - Karma $3</li>
		<p>Hello, Gregorian chants.</p>
		<li>Erasure - Wonderland $4.99</li>
		<li>Dirty Vegas - Dirty Vegas $2</li>
		<li>Mini PVC multipouch $1.75</li>
		<p>I left this behind initially because I didn't know what to put in it. I was only able to leave it behind once. I will FIND something to put in it.</p>
		<li>shoujo manga panel card sleeves $1.75</li>
		<p>2 different designs</p>
		<li>teddy bear card sleeves $1.75</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Back in Seattle last week, I went through the bargain bin at Al's. I always find something decent in it and the hit rate is much better than a thrift store. The price is 3 for $1.99, which brings the total price for all 9 CDs to $6 plus tax. I spent more on public transit to get there than I did on the haul!</p>

	<img src="../img/thrift/CIA03166.jpg">

	<ul>
		<li>Soul Asylum - Grave Dancers Union</li>
		<li>Thompson Twins - The Best of Thompson Twins Greatest Mixes</li>
		<li>Sophie B. Hawkins - Whaler</li>
		<p>Her first CD was NOT GOOD, but Ryan wanted a song on this one.</p>
		<li>New Order - (The Rest Of) New Order</li>
		<li>Delerium - Poem</li>
		<p>If you like Gregorian chants, check out Delerium's albums (and also Enigma)</p>
		<li>John '00' Fleming - Progressive Euphoria Disc 2</li>
		<p>Mix CD. After comparing track listings and database look up, this CD was definitely in the wrong case. It's the same kind of music though so I'm only upset there's no Bluegrass Tom in this mix.</p>
		<li>AFI - Sing The Sorrow</li>
		<li>Fuel - Something Like Human</li>
		<p>Such a reasonable price for a wishlist album!</p>
		<li>Various - Trance Nation 2003</li>
		<p>Missing the second disc. Mix CD.</p>
	</ul>

	<p>There's a record store downtown who mostly sells vinyl, but has a CD rack. He said he had recently moved all CDs on his rack that were $3 and under to his bargain bin. Thank you!!</p>

	<ul>
		<li>George Michael - Older $.50</li>
		<li>Jason Mraz - We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things $.50</li>
		<li>Junkie XL - Synthesized $.50</li>
		<li>Screaming Trees - Uncle Anesthesia $6</li>
		<li>Various - Ministry Of Sound The Annual 2002 $.50</li>
		<p>This one has Rapture by iiO, which I discovered as a child by watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buZaEXblK2M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weird a*s furry surfing on AlbinoBlackSheep</a> as a child. This is mix CD.</p>
		<li>Level 42 - World Machine $6</li>
		<p>I've been looking for this CD so long I actually spent that much on it ;____;</p>
		<li>Yes - Highlights - The Very Best Of Yes $.50</li>
		<li>Mr. Mister - Welcome to the Real World $.50</li>

		<li>Exeggcute $5</li>
		<p>They're eggs!! They're on a skateboard!!!</p>
		<li>18th Century French Painting $1</li>
		<p>The text is annoying because they're talking about paintings I've never seen and aren't shown. At least there's nice pictures.</p>
	</ul>

	<p>This store has a lot of discs from Buffalo & Erie County Library. New York is almost all the way across the country so I'm not sure how he's getting these.</p>
