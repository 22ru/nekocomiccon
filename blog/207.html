	<p>It's been a long time again already! I'm very neglectful...</p>

	<p>Ryan and I went to see my favorite mom! We heard about another local coffee shop in my hometown, so we checked it out. It was very good and very expensive. We got some well brewed pourovers~ Then went back the next morning and got another pair.</p>

	<p>I got back and was made fun of for not updating my computer, so I decided to upgrade my computer from Debian 10 to 12. A smart fooligan would have researched a little to find out this is a very bad idea to do a direct 10 -> 12 upgrade. I did no research. I paid the price!</p>

	<p>It's been a few days now and I have a fresh install of Debian 12. I have things mostly up and running with one exception. I decided to implement a ramdisk for my firefox profile! I have 2 SSD only in my PC and I'd like to not wear them out faster than I have to. I still haven't gotten startup/shutdown scripts implemented yet, but instead of working on that, I am writing this blog post.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, that was not the exception. The drivers for the joycon were changed, and the joycon no longer outputs the same events. My chiizukeiki is totally useless now! I'll have to put in a bit of work to fix it. Good thing I have plenty of sketchbooks right...</p>
