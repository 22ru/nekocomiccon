	<p>Ryan and I finished our rewatch of GITS:SAC and our first watch of GITS:SAC SSS. Ryan REFUSED to watch the ScarJo GITS with me. I watched it anyway.</p>

	<p>I have nothing good to say about it. It was pretty much trash. The creators may have watched the first movie or just read the wiki and picked out ideas and names they liked.</p>

	<p>We then rewatched the original GITS and I realized they were remaking many of the visuals from the first movie, while dumbing the plot down to American levels. I'm honestly impressed that they were able to make it so awful.</p>

	<p>Just watch SAC. It's good.</p>

	<p>A few photos of Cheby taken at around midnight with only a ringlight. I pulled out my 50mm f/1.4 for the best low light performance and I got to remember how easy it is to use!! What a good lens.</p>

	<p>The SDGrB Williams and SD13 Elizabeth announcement included an announcement for SD heel legs. I pray they will let me purchase these for Hina. I want them more than heel feet!!!</p>
