	<p>You can see Praline got a new outfit. I'm going to hate myself when I have to reiron those pleats in her skirt.</p>

	<p>Now that hinamatsuri is over, I will post boys exclusively again.</p>

	<p>Imgur has always had pretty shitty image quality, but somehow it got even worse recently. How?! I'm not even uploading a high resolution image! Do you really need to drop the quality to 10 to save space?? Sorry to everyone who views my DoA posts.</p>
