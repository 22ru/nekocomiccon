	<h2>I had the worst shopping experience at dystopian empire "UNIQLO"</h2>
	<div class="stats">
		(re)playing: Hotel Dusk: Room 215<br />
		thinkin bout: 33 year old detectives<br />
		missing: Dolpa
	</div>
	<h4 class="date">September 7, 2024</h4>

	<p>It seems I messed up the Dolpa venue location and ended up in Seattle over the weekend. Not sure how I screwed this up but it won't happen again.</p>

	<p>I went into UNIQLO looking for the Yoshitaka Amano art shirts that I saw last month that hit the clearance racks, but they must have sold out. Instead, I found some Oshi no Ko shirts (which you certainly know I am a huge fan of) on clearance. I picked out one with a bunny on stage and 3 more. bunny cute....</p>

	<p>I think my first mistake at UNIQLO was trying to find someone to take my money for these items. I looked and looked and all I saw was more cheaply made boring clothes and crowds of people excited to buy them. Eventually, I found the registers and they were all self check out. Not my favorite, but easy enough right?</p>

	<p>WRONG. I sat there trying to figure out how the machine was scanning my items. It kept double scanning despite me not having the barcode near it. I kept restarting and restarting and I still couldn't get the machine to stop double (triple and quadrouple) scanning my single shirt!! I finally called over the SCO employee and he said the UPCs don't matter and I just needed 4 items?! I couldn't even figure out how the register was scanning the dang things!</p>

	<p>I finally paid after freaking out for 5 minutes. As I left, I realized I had walked in the exit of the self checkout line. Even later, I realized there are RFID tags in each paper tag on the clothes... The grim cyberpunk future is here.</p>

	<p>I keep looking for Japan albums and I feel like I would pay more than usual for them, but I can never find any! Where are they?? Hello???</p>

	<p>I got trapped by the bargain bin deals again. I didn't really need 10,000 Maniacs or my own copy of Republica, so I convinced myself to put them back just as I walked up to the counter. I didn't put them back though because I was distracted by the dude buying a PS4 in front of me and Alex (the owner) recommending Nier: Automata (me too). This trip, I used my galaxy brain and brought my small CD holder and tossed the jewel cases in Seattle. Good idea!!</p>
