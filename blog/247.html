	<p>Have you heard of "brewed cocoa"? I found this in my mother's house about a year ago and took it for a spin! I have no idea where it was purchased so please no emails asking for more info on it.</p>

	<p>It expired in 2016, but I haven't died from drinking it yet. It smells like cocoa powder and the grounds are not at all evenly sized.</p>

	<p>I put 13 grams of it in the aeropress and 212 grams of 208 degree water. I'm using a metal filter today.</p>

	<p>This isn't the first time I've tried this but it has been a while. I brew coffee in the aeropress for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. I vaguely recall this having no flavor when having brewed that long, so I left I gave it a swirl at 8 minutes and pressed at 12 minutes, as the package recommends.</p>

	<p>This is by far the best tasting version of it I've made yet! It now tastes a bit like cocoa powder. It is usually "unpalatable" and "cover up the taste with half and half". I have no half and half right now, so I'm very thankful I let it brew longer. It's still bitter and unpleasant. I asked Ryan if he would like a taste and he said no. He has learned his lesson already.</p>

	<p>It left a gross feeling film on the surfaces of the aeropress. It wiped off easily with a paper towel.</p>

	<p>I wouldn't recommend this product at all! I hope you enjoyed my review! Thanks for watching!</p>
