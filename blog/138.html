    <p>It was terrible and I have no idea why it's considered a classic.</p>
 
    <p>The voice acting is actual children so you guessed it, it's even worse than normal american voice acting. The plot is uninteresting and just a complaint on consumerism. Snoopy was cute.</p>

    <p>I was very suprised to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@skunkpaste/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skunkpaste</a> wrote a small <a href="https://youtu.be/vzmidvCBeoc?t=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monolog</a> for it!</p>

	<p>Next I watched "It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown". It was a little better, but I can't recommend it.</p>

	<p>Then, I watched "Snoopy's Reunion". Skip it.</p>

	<p>"It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown" came next. This one is the only one I can recommend!! Perhaps only because there are so many Snoopy dance animations. They are very fun to watch.</p>

	<p>Today is Kikipop and Verona's birthday! Verona is 13 (older than some neocities users) and Kikipop is 7! I'm very happy to have these cuties!</p>

	<p>Volks enthusiasts may know that SD Ariel and a DD Rin/Len rerelease was announced at Dolpa. Rin has been on my wishlist due to being either 1st or 2nd most beautiful DD sculpt in my eyes, but I'm not sure I actually want her now that I have a chance. I'm not even sure I want another DD. Strange feeling and I guess I have something to think about.</p>

		<p>It's what I bought the whole danged thing for.</p>
		<li>Fortune telling clicker pen</li>
		<li>Manuscript calligraphy pen</li>
		<li>Tombow dual brush pen in pink</li>
		<p>I was wanting to buy a (lighter pink) one, so this was perfect! Except the brush nib is frayed and the ink on that side is almost out. Can I do surgery on a pen?</p>
		<li>Prismacolor white</li>
		<li>Prismacolor 05 pen</li>
		<li>sustainableseltzergoods Big Dipster pen</li>

		<li>Castell 9000 6B pencil</li>
		<li>Pilot G-2 .38</li>
		<li>Pelikan Super Pirat</li>
		<p>what to heck is this</p>
		<li>ONLINE refillable rollerball pen</li>
		<p>Someone stuck a (dried) full sized cartridge in it and I had to destroy it to get it out. I've been rinsing and soaking the dry ink out of this pen for days.</p>
		<li>Papermate clearpoint .7</li>
		<li>Pilot G-2 .5</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I used 5 of the knobs to replace the broken ones on my sewing desk, many pens have already been donated to the cause, and I just tossed the water bottle. You can't even sell this junk at a thrift store. I specifically bought it for the copic, but I'm excited to play with the refillable rollerball pen!</p>
