	<ul>
		<li>Phoenix - Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix $.50</li>
		<p>Wait is this song isn't about Franz Liszt??? Coolest find about this CD, which is unrelated to this CD is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzT3UFjL8G4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>!</p>
		<li>The Sounds - Dying to Tell You $.50</li>
		<p>Tough girl music.</p>
		<li>Train - Save Me, San Francisco $.50</li>
		<li>The Used - In Love and Death $.50</li>
		<p>I own a button pin of them yet know none of their music? Total poser!! It's very emo with a little screaming, but not too much.</p>
		<li>Troye Sivan - Bloom $.50</li>
		<p>Never heard of him but he sounds like the more boring part of Justin Bieber's career. He's writing songs about gay b*****x if you are into that kinda stuff...</p>
		<li>Saves the Day - Sound the Alarm $.50</li>
		<p>More whiny emo boiz.</p>
		<li>Fall Out Boy - American Beauty / American Psycho $.50</li>
		<li>Over It - Timing is Everything $.50</li>
		<li>Boyzone - Where We Belong $.50</li>
		<li>The Pale Pacific - Rules are Predicable $.50</li>
		<p>I didn't expect much from this but I was pleasantly surprised with the first song.</p>
		<li>Pope's autograph $.50</li>
		<li>Solzhenitsyn A Pictoral Autobiography $.75</li>
		<li>Foray ballpoint refills (Cross) $.50</li>
		<li>Teddy Bear Encyclopedia $1.50</li>
		<li>Nebraska magnet $???</li>
		<li>Wiimote cable extender $0</li>
		<p>I have to wonder what the use case for this is. How long do your arms have to be for this to be useful?</p>
