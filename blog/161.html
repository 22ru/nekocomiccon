    <p>It's spring it's spring!!! Go outside and look at the flowers!!! The baby animals are out there too!! I saw two baby squirrels in my driveway snuggling. so cute ;a;</p>

    <p>I wasn't sure about this jumper I made for Hina, but I got a suggestion from hors to make a turtleneck to go under it. Very good idea! I'd still like to add doll sized buttons to the front, but I dont have any small enough!</p>

    <p>I packed Hina up for some hanami photos again and dragged her butt to the trees.</p>

    <p>I went back just a couple days later to the same area for more photos. Gone! All of the blossoms were gone!! I took photos elsewhere anyway and survived every stare. Have I mastered the art of being stared at yet??</p>

    <p>Liam got a matching shirt! I put the blonde wig on him and I think it's stuck?? I can't get it off!</p>

    <p>This bush outside my house is very pretty but it keeps stabbing me!! How rude. I'm so mad at this dang flowering bush.</p>
