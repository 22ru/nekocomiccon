	<p>I went back to the record shop to test out the 35mm lens and had a successful trip even though I took too long. Sorry Ryan!</p>

	<p>I asked to see the 35mm lens and he had a lot of trouble getting it on my adapter. There's a little removable peg in my adapter that has to be removed before the lens fits on it. He finally got it on and the focus ring was super tight. He oiled it for me and distracted me by handing me another lens.</p>

	<p>The other lens is a CIMKO MT-X 28-105mm f/3.5-4.9. Google turns up with almost nothins on this lens but a dead blog that just redirects. It says "JAPAN" but not much else. </p>

	<p>I ended up getting both lenses and 2 Incubus CDs for $50. The price on the 35mm was $55. I was originally planning to haggle him down to $40 for it. It's still a little tight in one direction but hopefully it'll loosen up.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Grookey $.50</li>
		<p>I have been recently informed that this is not Grookey.</p>
		<li>Peelander-Z P-TV-Z $.99</li>
		<p>I was curious enough to buy this. It appears to be signed by 3 people who I assume are in the band.</p>
		<li>Incubus - S.C.I.E.N.C.E.</li>
		<li>Incubus - A Crow Left of the Murder</li>
		<li>Crystal Method - Tweekend $.99</li>
		<li>My Chemical Romance - Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</li>
		<li>Rammstein - Reise, Reise</li>
