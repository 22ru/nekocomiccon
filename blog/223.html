	<p>It's birthday season!!! That means it's time for my two Migidoll boys to be celebrated!!</p>

	<p>It's still 80 degrees outside here and yet the leaves are already giving up the ghost. It gave me a good fall look perfect for late September!</p>

	<p>First up is Pafachan, who was completed 2 years ago yesterday~</p>

	<p>I used the Canon FD 50mm f/1.4 with the Vivitar 2x teleconverter for all of these. The teleconverter adds a ton of glow, which I have removed a lot of. I also found I couldn't get anything close to a sharp focus if I was further away. It's an interesting addition to my collection! I like playing with it.</p>

	<p>I spent well over a week tweaking Volta's new pants pattern that I started before moving in July. 7 mock ups later, I finally came up with one that is good enough. Thank Mana-sama because it was getting a little embarrassing to have a naked boy in my room.</p>

	<p>I decided to take a shortcut patterning/cutting that caused me to have to rip the thing apart and reorganize my thoughts again. They're done now except that I can't decide on the closure for them. I don't like how the eye and hook is visible with them shut, but they might bust open a simple snap.</p>
