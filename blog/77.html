	<h2>Happy Valentine's Day!!!!</h2>
	<h4 class="date">February 14, 2022</h4>

    <p>lots of pictures of my love to celebrate!</p>

    <img src="../img/HAT07029.jpg" />

    <p>I took this next one in January but I think I like the one I just took better. I did the wild thing where you take a paintbrush to your $1k doll today and gave her smile marks. it was terrifying and i couldnt stop shaking but i think it worked out okay. im so happy to see her smile :3</p>

    <p>Valentine's day is also.... Frederica's birthday! I took another photo of Ryan's figure this year.</p>

    <p>I also gave Karen some time in the spotlight. I though her look was perfect for a Valentine's Day shot. She's quite a bit shinier than Freddy of course, but prize figure quality really has come up over the last 5 years. She's definitely not the same quality as a scale but they did a lot better of a job sculpting than they used to.</p>

    <p>it's been so lovely outside! a break from snow is very welcome imo. ryan and I got to take a walk on saturday where we hit both thrift stores and the used book store!</p>

    <img src="../img/thrift/HAT07000.jpg" />

    <ul>
        <li>cast iron pan $3.65</li>
        <p>looks antique but the bottom is so "well seasoned". I scraped it off but only found "No.5 8 1/2 in." Who knows which brand that is. I'm always looking at cast irons with smooth interiors.</p>

        <li>guitar hand thing $.95</li>

        <li>Tokyo Look Book $0</li>
        <p>I've been wanting this book for months at the book store but it was $6 and the binding was completely destroyed. I just couldn't justify spending money on a trash book even if there were pictures of Mana-sama inside. I went up to the employee and tried to politely ask for a discount because of the binding, and she told me "We don't sell junk books. You can just take it." I'll see if it's any good before I try to fix the binding.</p>

        <li>Jumbo book cover $.59</li>
        <p>idk why ryan wanted this because i never got them to fit over my books.</p>

        <li>chalk $.20</li>
        <p>hopefully i can carefully mark some fabric with this. warn me now if thats a bad idea</p>

        <li>Happy birthday Grandma card $.25</li>
        <p>it's so cute ;_; i wish i had a grandma to send it to. i wanted to send it to my mom instead but ryan says that will just give her a heart attack</p>

        <li>Punch-Drunk Love $.99</li>
        <p>never heard of it.</p>

        <li>wool(?) scarf $1</li>
        <p>someone liked this enough to stitch their name tag into it</p>

        <li>1k card sleeves $5</li>

        <li>The Gulag Archipelago $.50</li>

        <li>Dritz Quilter's Gauge $0</li>
        <p>Thrift store lady thought this was worthless and said it cost 10 cents but then forgot to charge me and didn't care to fix it when I asked if she remembered.</p>

        <li>"let's get together" cards with birds $.25</li>

        <li>half a broken doll stand $.95</li>
        <p>hoping I can get this to hold up my hina dress form.</p>
    </ul>
