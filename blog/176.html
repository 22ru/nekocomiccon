    <p>I have solved the great Music Issue of 2023.</p>

    <p>First, after days of searching, I found my lightning to 3.5mm adapters. After tearing apart my entire apartment, it was located in my bento box of adapters. Right... where... I should have guessed.....</p>

    <p>Secondly, I was recommended VLC for iOS. I downloaded it and it allows me to copy files directly to my phone WITHOUT ITUNES ON DEBIAN. I removed all the songs from my phone with iTunes and started fresh. I'm very happy with it!</p>
