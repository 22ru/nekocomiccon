    <p>Jilly Jelly?! Jilly Jelly!!! What an exciting announcement for Kinoko Juice fans worldwide! I'm praying for a gyaru release so I can convince Kohi she needs one.</p>

    <p>When I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/kame_kj/status/1668060829001080832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">megane Shizuku</a> I feel in love just a little.</p>

    <p>So I drew her!!! Shizuku is so cute in glasses. She makes me want one ;_________; I sent it to Kame already and she sent me a happy response!</p>

    <p>I'm being tempted again by punk Kiki with the exchange rate working in my favor again. Does anyone want to give me $250?? No??? Please help me fill the void in my life with even more dolls!</p>
