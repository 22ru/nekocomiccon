		<li>American Apparel dress $3.25</li>
		<p>Shown from behind. It's an xs and does fit but is a little tight. Waistlines always hit at my rib cage and I can't lose weight around my ribs so I'm not sure how uncomfortable this will be. It's really nicely made though. Maybe I'll just have some ribs removed.</p>
