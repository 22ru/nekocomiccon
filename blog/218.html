	<p>It is very unfortunate, but <a href="https://zucchini.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hors</a> must be shamed.</p>

	<p>On the year of our lord Sunday, August 18th, hors messaged me asking if she should preorder QLYwork Minie. I was unable to respond immediately due to rolling around in a storage unit.</p>

	<p>By the time I saw the message, Minie was preordered! Even worse, Mima was not asked! Mima did not give permission!!!</p>

	<p>It is terrible we have to do this but, shame on you, hors. smh....</p>

	<p>I spent an entire week trying to figure out why my new sewing machine had the absolute worst tension issues I've ever seen. The stitches were absolutely trash! After a few sleepless nights and hours of switching and swapping things out, I finally figured out the bobbin wasn't being loaded correctly. I seriously tried everything I could think of before that! I'm so relieved.</p>

	<p>My small desk has become my computer desk, drawing desk, and sewing machine desk. It's rather inconvenient so I'm organizing my room AGAIN.I gotta make some room to do something or I'll go nuts!</p>
