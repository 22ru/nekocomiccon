	<h2>filter day</h2>
    <h4 class="date">May 19, 2021</h4>

	<p>i broke my first thrift store item today. i picked up a bucket of knives from above my head level and one fell out at me. i made the correct decision to step away instead of try to catch it, but it had a porcelain handle that shattered. they didnt make me pay for it but oops...</p>
