	<h2>new outfit 4 cheby</h2>

    <p>Can you believe it? My beautiful girl has made her NFT debut!! I installed her on my webpage so you all can see her. Please click her to find my RSS feed!</p>

    <p>I'm using Newsboat to view my feeds. I had not opened it in so long that I had to google "linux terminal rss reader" to figure out what I already had installed. RSS seems like a really dumb way to start microblogging but I will control myself for now.</p>

    <p>I just learned about the new J Biebz album! I heard a song I didn't recognize on the radio and thought "wow that sounds just like the biebz but this song wasn't on his last album". I looked it up and... I missed a whole album last year?! I had no idea! Fake fan am I right??</p>

    <p>Ryan told me to listen to it on youtube before I ran out to buy it. I did and I won't be buying it outside of a thrift store. My review of this album is: Justin Bieber will die in the next 10 years due to suicide or overdose. This is a cry for help.</p>

    <p>But seriously my biggest turn off was him singing about weed ðŸ¤®</p>

    <p>I had designed a cute fall dress to make with my leaf pattern fabric from <a href="107.html">blog 107</a>!! And then I went and made a yukata out of it. No one stopped me! I used H=54, WS=45, and SL=13.2 for this one. I am so incredibly thankful to my past self for making the tutorial on it because I could not remember how to do it. I also used my machine a lot more so it didn't take 5000 hours of hand stitching.</p>

    <p>I made this for Cheby, but to be completely honest, I wanted Hina to be able to wear it too. It is sewn as a women's yukata because of that. I made a promise to never crossdress him when I got him but that was over quick. Sorry, cheby. </p>

    <p>The SD13B body makes me dislike the oYID body more and more. He's more stiff and his fingers feel like sausages next to SD13! I really really want to replace Liam's body now. I don't think Cheby is on the long leg body so maybe it'll be okay if I find a WS long leg SD13B body. Cheby is in platform boots in this photo, but their heights aren't noticeably off.</p>
