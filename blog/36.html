    <p>hello everynyan! i was chatting with a friend and remembered a banned doll (according to DoA rules) and i went to go look her up!</p>


    <p>for everyone worried, its the 2015 issue of <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/angell-studio/art/Princess-Cinderella-528047765"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">princess cinderella by angell-studio</a>! her first sculpt used to be on my wishlist way back so i was really shocked to see it!</p>

    <p>i found the old photos and a tumblr post saying she was accused of being a copy of Volks F-01. i guess the outrage was all in the chinese community though. now i can kinda see what they mean? she does look a bit like F-01, but i dont think id go as far as to accuse her of being a copy!</p>

    <p>so now that i'm already on the angell-studio website, i found <a href="https://www.angell-studio.com/biyao-new-immortal-fantasy_p1727.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this cutie, biyao!</a> shes rather cute, i like her little smile!</p>

    <p>i clicked around a bit more and found.... <a href="https://www.angell-studio.com/biyao-new-immortal-fantasy_p1727.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this DUDE.</a> is this even legal??? definitely not safe for work!!!! JESUS. do not look closely at the 2nd to last picture</p>

    <p>i am not digging their anime style dolls. their "semi-real" "stylized" whatever dolls are looking very pro now! they've definitely come a long way since 2010</p>
