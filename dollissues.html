<h2>A List of Issues</h2>
<p>Sometimes, this info is lost to time. ALWAYS check the DoA reviews (<a href="https://denofangels.com/forums/company-reviews-service.91/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">service subforum</a>, <a href="https://denofangels.com/forums/company-reviews-products.147/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product subforum</a>)! I will be collecting accounts here that may not make it into those threads.</p>

<h3>BJDivas (USA BJD dealer)</h3>
	<h4>Zest Vs. BJDivas (8/31/2021)</h4>
	<p>A DoA user made a <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/can-i-ask-for-a-refund-2-year-wait-lost-order.846108/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a> asking if it would be too bothersome to ask BJDivas for a refund for their doll they had been waiting for over 2 years for. The overwhelming majority of the thread said yes, of course. A few people came out of the woodwork with a few complaints about BJDiva's service. This includes Zest and Zest had some big complaints.</p>

	<p>BJDivas decided 2 of the posts in this thread were slanderous. They made a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BJDivas/posts/1256111538185287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="i cant actually tell if this link works because i dont have a facebook account">post on facebook</a> about how the posts were completely untrue (one of the posts is pretty speculative) and said they had asked the mods to remove both of these posts. These posts have not been removed and the thread was locked.</p>

	<p>BJDivas decided they no longer wanted to work with Zest. They transferred his preorder back to Dollzone and sent him an email about it. Zest posted in the <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/dollzone-waiting-room-v16.818228/page-40#post-12970577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dollzone waiting room</a> about this and BJDivas responded, ending up in the thread becoming heated and locked for a month. BJDivas took the drama over to their public facebook page where they named and shamed Zest, including his real name. BJDivas claims they only posted his real name because he had already posted it.</p>

	<p>Zest, with the permission of the mods, wrote and posted a review in the BJDivas DoA feedback thread. BJDivas did not like the review, so they posted a rebuttal and asked the moderators to remove the post. They asked on their private facebook group for people to leave feedback for them in their <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/bjdivas.741024/page-4#post-12955027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DoA feedback thread</a> around July 20th, 2021. 33 reviews popped up within the next 2 months, mostly from older orders. Two of these reviews were not positive and BJDivas posted a rebuttal to both. <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/bjdivas.741024/page-4#post-12972767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One of them</a> suggests BJDivas is on a witch hunt for all of Zest's lackeys.</p>

	<p>In a <a href="https://bjdivas.com/update-regarding-targeted-harassment-and-disinformative-allegations/?v=7516fd43adaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on their website</a>, BJDivas even goes as far to blame the DoA mods' unfair judgement on the face they have not donated to them or bought advertising. BJDivas has claimed that Zest sent his personal army after them. Claiming they are receiving death threats, saying someone tried to shut down their website, etc. This could be true, but they have not posted screenshots of anything as far as I can see. They have decided to not press charges against Zest or DoA. <a href="https://bookerdewittless.tumblr.com/post/667046077306961920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zest says</a> his multiple attempts at contact and chargebacks were due to his order becoming stuck in limbo until he could receive their consent to transfer. Both BJDivas and Zest recieved a 1 month suspension for their argument. BJDivas has recieved a "Dealer Caution" banner as well for their actions. </p>

<h3><span style="color:red">DO NOT ORDER FROM</span> Dolk (Japanese dealer)</h3>
	<p>There are an insane amount of issues coming out of this company. Many of them being taking months to ship and in stock doll and charging twice for shipping.</p>

	<h4>Myoudoll Hershey's faceup (10/18/2022)</h4>
	<p>See <a href="#myouxdolk">this</a>.</p>

<h3><span style="color:red">DO NOT ORDER FROM</span> Dollshe Craft</h3>
	<p>Over so many years in this hobby, I have never ever seen so many unhappy people waiting years for dolls while funding a Ponzi scheme. I can't even choose a few posts to show the misery of the people with open orders.</p>

<h3>Jane's Dolland</h3>
	<h4>(Former) recast supporter (pre-2021)</h4>
	<p>I am not at all accusing Jane's Dolland of currently selling recasts, but there is feedback in her <a href="https://feedback.ebay.com/fdbk/feedback_profile/huajan3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay feedback history</a> saying she has sold recasts in the past. Just something to keep in mind.</p>

<h3>MyDollection</h3>
	<h4>No more free shipping (10/4/2022)</h4>
	<p>DoA user <a href="https://denofangels.com/posts/13068033/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elzaim</a> posted that she had orded a full box of blind box BJDs from MyDollection during a time when they were offering free worldwide shipping. Months later, the dolls were ready to be sent and MyDollection asked for $78 USD to cover the shipping costs. Elzaim came up with proof that free shipping was being offered at the time, but MyDollection refused to cover it. The resolution was a refund from MyDollection and no dolls.</p>

<h3>Myoudoll</h3>
	<h4 id="myouxdolk">Myoudoll Hershey's faceup (10/18/2022)</h4>
	<p>A Japanese twitter user ordered a Myoudoll with faceup through Dolk. The doll arrived with possibly <a href="https://twitter.com/kohaku_9090/status/1582338884641226753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the worst default faceup ever</a>. Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/kohaku_9090/status/1582364592654909441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo</a> of the alternate mouth pieces. Myou must have run out of red paint!</p>

<h3>Volks</h3>
	<h4>Yellowed feet (Personal experience, May 2022)</h4>
	<p>I had ordered a few sets of "owner limited" hands along with a pair of tabi feet from VolksUSA for Hina. Please note that owner limited hands are sent from Japan, while tabi feet are an item kept in stock at most times. After few months, all of the option parts arrived. I was very disappointed to notice the feet were yellow compared to my doll and the hands. They had obviously been produced years ago.</p>

	<p>I contacted VolksUSA about my issue and tried to take a photo showing the color difference between the feet and hands. I truly just wanted a pair that matched my doll, but they were unable to offer me an exchange and offered me only a refund with a prepaid shipping label. I did not take their offer after running my options, but I am very displeased with this transaction. I am hesitant to buy in stock items from them other than Volks News now.</p>

	<h4>Moths (12/16/2021)</h4>
	<p>A Korean twitter user opened her brand new SD Charlotte bought through Haruhana and found moths inside (<a href="https://twitter.com/JinMaeHyang/status/1471726861831262208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JinMaeHyang/status/1471894092938629122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JinMaeHyang/status/1471899956755955712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>). Haruhana agreed to exchange her doll for her, excluding the head because she had already removed the eyes (<a href="https://twitter.com/jinmaehyang/status/1474246196785205248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a>).</p>

	<h4>DD 2B's cracked neckhole (June 2020)</h4>
	<p>Not one, not two, but many people complained that their DD 2B came with cracks in the vinyl of her neckhole. Some were smaller cracks, some were larger (<a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=247861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=247762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=247663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>). 9S did not seem to have these issues. Concern was voiced that the cracks would grow larger over time and cause issues with head looseness, if the head was not loose already. </p>

	<p>A few users on DollDreaming contacted Volks/VolksUSA about this issue. Volks originally claimed that cracks in the neckhole were normal and acceptable. Id still displeased, VolksUSA required the users to ship the heads back to them to inspect the damage. DollDreaming users <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=248307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raine</a>, <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=249743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oyashiro</a>, <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=250497" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mayaiincho</a> did receive a replacement</a>. User <a href="https://www.dolldreaming.com/topic/14893-nier-automata-x-dollfie-dream/?do=findComment&comment=248134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growcian</a> did not send his head in and was not offered a replacement.</p>

	<p>There was a rumor of a shipment of Nier:Automata dolls being lost to a sunken cargo ship, but I have yet to see any posts detailing this event.</p>
