    <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHdOXCoja-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memories of Doll</a></h2>

    <h3 id="history">the end of money</h3>
	<p>around 2007-2008 I was super interested in visual kei. I spent my days dreaming of miyavi and gackt and searching deviantart and other online art communities for whatever inspired me. <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/ryupon/art/ViSuAl-Homme-Ducan-ryu-jr-71104566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">i came across this photo on deviantart while searching for vkei.</a> i was just a little smitten. july 23, 2008 was the day I discovered DOD Ducan and the beginning of the end.</p>

	<p>i spent the next few years mopping floors, collecting christmas and birthday money, and doing anything I could to buy dolls. I was lucky to be in a pretty good situation where after a few months I was able to afford my first doll. My mom was very supportive of me getting cute girl dolls (not so much the boys) and helped me a lot. not everyone is so lucky!</p>

	<p>my tastes started to change as i grew out of being a teen and i started to highly prefer girl dolls. i started noticing DDs as well! they didnt really look good until around 2011 or so. i tried to sell a few of my dolls to buy new dolls but i didnt really find buyers. Now I would prefer to make more money if i want other dolls. i am thankful almost all of my previous dolls never found buyers. i've had so many memories with them that i would be sad to not have them now</p>

	<p>i didn't really have any income during college so i didn't get many dolls during that time. i don't call it a "hiatus" or anything since i never stopped loving them and playing with them despite not buying anything or posting online.</p>

    <h3>meetups and coventions</h3>
        <p>I had a wonderful meet up group called Inland Northwest Resin (INWR)! We had a facebook page and our own forum! We had so many fun meetups and it was just about the first time in my life my mom would let me go off and do things without her.</p>
        <p>It was so fun to gush over the new dolls coming out and try out other dolls and see if I like them enough to want to own them myself. Most of us got into a weird obsession with Bluefairy together and probably had the largest number of BlueFairy dolls per capita back in the day. Together we went to gardens, cafes, restaurants, and had dolly "spa" meets.</p>
        <p>I got to attend multiple RadCons with these girls as well as Uncanny Dream 2011, PNW BJD Expo 2013 and 2014.</p>
        <p>thank you to all my doll comm for spending time with me over the first years! Rei, Jenn, Bri, I miss you all so much! and thank you to Amanda for listening to me obsess over them for more than a couple years! also sorry for getting you into an expensive hobby :p</p>

    <h3>Den of Demons</h3>
        <p>If you think these girls were as catty as the girls on /cgl/ you are dead wrong. It was more tame than you'd expect.</p>

    <h3>Notable People</h3>
        <p>anything I write here is probably spicier than anything posted on Den of Demons</p>

        <h4>Hiritai</h4>
            <p>Aeryn had tons of boys every teenage girl had a crush on!</p>

            <p>She recieved a marketplace ban from DoA and hasn't really been active since. She did that thing where you disappear off the face of the Earth with multiple open transactions.</p>

        <h4>Belladonna</h4>
            <p>She was once quite a popular photographer and faceup artist with many beautiful boys. Sisters with gardenofmoons/frozen wings.</p>

            <p>She once had 2 doll heads run over by a car <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/worst-doll-experience-ever.515204/page-10#post-9230288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(DOA link)</a>.</p>

        <h4>Andreja</h4>
            <p>Faceup artist, photographer, and pioneer of the oversized sweater, yoga pants, alpaca wig minifee movement. I'm not sure any other artist has had such an impact on the western community.</p>
            <p>She doesn't participate in BJDs anymore, but has moved on to other art projects. Her influence will likely last forever though.</p>

        <h4>Culur</h4>
            <p>My first memory of culur was at pnw bbq expo. I saw a young girl with a gorgeous minifee. I found out soon after it was Culur and her recast. She didn't really care that bringing a recast was against the rules apparently.</p>
            <p>She has a long history of being dishonest. Her dolls are very iconic, but please keep this in mind when dealing with her.</p>


    <h3>Iconic Sculpts</h3>
        <p>These dolls were all super popular at some point in the English speaking doll community, so you'd see a lot of them around! Most of my info was stolen or inspired by <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/what-dolls-do-you-consider-iconic-why.842910/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this thread on DoA</a>.</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>CP Delf El</li>
            <p>The "El Army" is no joke!</p>
            
            <li>DOD Ducan</li>
            <p>I'm not sure if everyone and their dog even had one, but there are even cosplays of this doll.</p>
            
            <li>Volks Four Sisters/F-01/etc</li>
            <p>The first super dollfie released by Volks. Her face is a little lopsided and they make sure to keep it that way every time they resculpt it in another size.</p>
            <p>After all these years, she is still extremely popular and iconic!</p>
            
            <li>Dollshe Hound/Bermann/Saint</li>
            <p>I can't identify these ones by first glance but people would not stop talking about them before 2010! They were once one of the most expensive dolls you could own. They were the first of the 70cm (uncle) range dolls.</p>
            <p>In the olden days, you used to have to order Dollshe dolls through Luts, then Tensiya, a company run by Anu. At least internationally, they were not sold regularly and were pretty hard to get ahold of! You'd often see them going for $2000+ USD.</p>
            <p>The abbreviation for sleeping heads, SA, stands for <a href="https://denofangels.com/threads/bermann-comparisons-new-old-warning-some-doll-skin.12998/#post-149640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slack afternoon</a>.</p>
            
            <li>Unoa Lusis</li>
            <p>Highly sought after in the early days and was extremely tough to obtain. Still very popular and much easier to get now!</p>
            
            <li>Zaoll Luv</li>
            <p>So many people seemed to have male versions of this doll. Sand off the chest and you're good to go. Technically an SD sized doll, but pretty significantly shorter than most at 52cm tall!</p>
            
            <li>Fairyland Minifee Chloe</li>
            <p>Andreja (Nicolle's Dreams) had and painted one and the rest was history. Probably the first doll a lot of people saw through Youtube or Instagram. If you want to gain a large social media following, this is your girl.</p>

            <li>Fifth Motif Venitu</li>

            <li>Soom Dia</li>
            <p>originally a female sculpt with some giant lips. you'll see most of them as boys though.</p>
        </ul>

    <h3 id="lottery">my volks lottery win rate!</h3>
            <p>0/4 0% but I'm not giving up yet! Mother SD will bless me someday. A secret trick for checking if you won early on VolksUSA is to go to your user profile details and check if a "user group" tab shows up. It's best not to celebrate until you get an email though!</p>
