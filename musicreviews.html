<h2>My Opinion is Law</h2>
<p>I said I wouldn't make a collection page for my CDs but I (or Ryan) do own all of these. I won't rate a greatest hits album here. That's cheating.</p>

<p>My opinion on compact discs: These are the best medium ever!!! Disc rot and children can happen, but these aren't destroyed by using them. They're easily rippable and probably the best quality you can get without stealing the master. These have become worthless in recent years, so stock up!</p>

<p>My opinion on vinyl records: why. Don't gimme dat.</p>

<p>If you don't enjoy new wave, nu metal, or anime bullsh*t, you're better off reading someone else's music reviews!</p>

<h3>98° - 98° And Rising ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>It's good but not too notable. Less overproduced than Backstreet Boys and NSYNC.</p>

<h3>A.F.I. - Decemberunderground ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I'm pretty sure the lyrics are nonsense but this album is premium angst-filled men tier fun. I seriously love it.</p>

<h3>a-ha - Hunting High And Low ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I probably spent days listening to this album while sewing doll clothes as a teen.</p>

<h3>Ace of Base - The Sign ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I listen to it on repeat.</p>

<h3>Alphaville - Forever Young ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I expected all of the album to sound like Forever Young, but that's the slowest one on the album. Allegedly, there's a faster version of Forever Young out there. Please contact me if you have it. Favorite song: Fallen Angel</p>

<h3>Backstreet Boys - Millenium ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Premium boy band experience.</p>

<h3>Backstreet Boys - Black & Blue ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I love to start out an album listening to an unapologetic cheating song and then continuing to seemingly devoted love songs.</p>

<h3>BIGBANG - ALIVE ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's really short! Only 7 tracks and one is an intro song. I haven't heard these songs in 10 years so it was nostalgic to hear them again. All the songs are pretty boppy and fun. Do I count as a kpopper now that I own this album?</p>

<h3>Bjork - Post ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Delete "It's Oh So Quiet" before listening and you have a great album!</p>

<h3>Bush - Sixteen Stone ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Wow I already knew most of the songs from radio play. Lotta hits on this one.</p>

<h3>Creed - Weathered ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>We had a ripped copy of this CD when I was a kid and I spent a lot of time making fun of it but it's really fun to sing.</p>

<h3>The Crow Soundtrack ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>The entire album is made by The Cure - Burn and NIN - Dead Souls. I don't know if either of these tracks were released elsewhere. These two are good enough to make up for the not great songs on the album.</p>

<h3>Daft Punk - Random Access Memories ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>There's a few pretty good ones! I really like Fragments of Time, Doin' It Right, Instant Crush. Some others are easily skippable.</p>

<h3>David Bowie - The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars ★★★★★</h3>
<p>It's the best Bowie album of all time. You can't change my mind.</p>

<h3>Depeche Mode - Violator ★★★★★</h3>
<p>Favorite song: Enjoy the Silence</p>

<h3>Edie Brickell & The New Bohemians - Shooting Rubberbands at the Moon ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>What I Am is good but the rest of the album means nothing to me.</p>

<h3>Eiffel 65 - Europop (US Version) ★★★★★</h3>
<p>what is DUB in this life!?! I have NO idea!!!!</p>
<p>I have definitely overlistened to Blue, so I skip that one, but wowie zowie this CD is GOOD. I don't think there's a single song on this CD I don't love.</p>

<h3>Eurythmics - Revenge ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I can't remember any of this album despite having listened to it a few times.</p>

<h3>Hangry & Angry - Kill Me Kiss Me ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>This group is just a h.NAOTO publicity stunt but these songs are great.</p>

<h3>Hinder - Take it to the Limit ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>boring. not even the singles are fun to listen to.</p>

<h3>Howard Jones - The 12" Album ★★★★★</h3>
<p>6 Very Good Songs</p>

<h3>Howard Jones - Cross That Line ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>There's some good songs but he's moving away from the new wave style I love so much.</p>

<h3>Howard Jones - In The Running ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>New wave is gone. It's just too slow for me. But! My copy is autographed. *__________*</p>

<h3>Huey Lewis And The News - Sports ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I don't think there's anything I can complain about. I have the expanded one with Live versions, which I dislike.</p>

<h3>The Human League - Dare ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's decent!</p>

<h3>Incubus - Make Yourself ★★★★☆</h3>

<h3>Justin Bieber - My World 2.0 ★★★★★</h3>
<p>It's so cute! I love it. It's fun to sing and poppy! What more could you need in life?! HE'S SO CUTE</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - Believe ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Another great J Biebz album. Maria was a bad take. Favorite song: Thought of You</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - Purpose ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Still a good album, but on the decline. Favorite song: Been You (a Target exclusive?!)</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - Changes ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I'm not sure I liked any of the songs on this album. I was really excited for it too. I won't buy the next one.</p>

<h3>Justin Timberlake - Justified ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's catchy and good but is he allowed to sing that??? The lyrics are pretty spicy.</p>

<h3>Justin Timberlake - The 20/20 Experience ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>I spent many years never being able to get past Mirrors, but I eventually did and the rest of the album was good too. Favorite song: Mirrors</p>

<h3>Ke$ha - Warrior ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Fun beats but holy cow the whole album is a love letter to degeneracy.</p>

<h3>Michael Jackson - Thriller (25 Anniversary Edition) ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Original album: ★★★★☆ <br />
The remixes on this are absolutely god awful.</p>

<h3>Milli Vanilli - Girl You Know It's True ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Nothing notable.</p>

<h3>Muse - Showbiz ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Unexciting album. Whiny voice and no bangers.</p>

<h3>My Chemical Romance - Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>This is totally an album you'd expect me to like but I just don't care about it. I don't even want to sing along.</p>

<h3>Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Pretty neutral. I'm still shocked after hearing the uncensored version of Closer and I'm not sure why. What could I have possibly thought he was singing?!</p>

<h3>Nine Inch Nails - With Teeth ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Pretty good album. Gonna think about changing this one to a 4 star.</p>

<h3>Oingo Boingo - Only a Lad ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I think this one is just a little too silly for me.</p>

<h3>A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Wowie this CD is good. Sleeping Beauty will always remind me of a Light x L fan flash that I'll never be able to link. I hope I saved it on my HDD! Update: I will never be able to watch this fan flash by go-devil-dante again and I am so upset about it.</p>

<h3>A Perfect Circle - Thirteenth Step ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I can't actually tell you what's on this CD because it's in the playlist right after the first one. I promise you the whole thing is a good time.</p>

<h3>A Perfect Circle - Eat the Elephant ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I think he forgot to put a banger in it. Very neutral.</p>

<h3>Puddle of Mudd - Come Clean ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I was way too old when I found out the song wasn't "she freakin blocked me".</p>

<h3>Savage Garden - Savage Garden ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I kept calling it the Jojo OST but I actually listened to it and then listened to it like 20 more times. I like in Santa Monica where he sings that you can be anyone you want on the phone. Same.</p>

<h3>Savage Garden - Affirmation ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Some good songs, some bad songs. A lot of the lyrics make me want to bang my head on the desk. It would be really good if I didn't understand English. The Best Thing is on this album which I think is one of their top bangers. He was definitely divorce bitter and "exploring his sexuality" at the time of writing this album.</p>

<h3>Seal - Seal (1991) ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>It's a really good one! I had a mix CD with Crazy on it back in the day and it's good to hear it again. I didn't originally like Killer, but I'm into it now.</p>

<h3>Seal - Seal (1994) ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Jesus Christ why did you name two albums the same thing. Whatever. They're both great. Favorite song: Kiss from a Rose (duh)</p>

<h3>Siouxsie and the Banshees - Peepshow ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>It's just so inoffensive. I don't even care.</p>

<h3>Staind - Dysfunction ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's a little rough but I still like it. F*ck hidden tracks.</p>

<h3>Staind - Break The Cycle ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Many fun songs to sing!</p>

<h3>Staind - 12 Shades of Grey  ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>This dude was hella upset about Layne Staley.</p>

<h3>The Strokes - Is This It ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Did anyone else notice these guys and the Killers sound exactly the same? Nothing really stuck out to me.</p>

<h3>Wang Chung - To Live And Die In L.A ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Vocal tracks are very good. Unfortunately there's only 3 of them.</p>

<h3>Yui - Can't Buy My Love ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Fun and poppy jpop! I hadn't heard the songs before, but it makes me nostalgic for my early weeaboo days.</p>
