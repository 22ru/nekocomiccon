<h2>My Opinion is Law</h2>
<p>I said I wouldn't make a collection page for my CDs but I (or Ryan) do own all of these. I won't rate a greatest hits album here. That's cheating.</p>

<h3>a-ha - Hunting High And Low ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I probably spent days listening to this album while sewing doll clothes as a teen.</p>

<h3>Ace of Base - The Sign ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I listen to it on repeat.</p>

<h3>Alphaville - Forever Young ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I expected all of the album to sound like Forever Young, but that's the slowest one on the album. Allegedly, there's a faster version of Forever Young out there. Please email me if you have it. Favorite song: Fallen Angel</p>

<h3>Bjork - Post ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Delete "It's Oh So Quiet" before listening and you have a great album!</p>

<h3>Creed - Weathered ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>We had a ripped copy of this CD when I was a kid and I spent a lot of time making fun of it but it's really fun to sing.</p>

<h3>Daft Punk - Random Access Memories ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>There's a few pretty good ones! I really like Fragments of Time, Doin' It Right, Instant Crush. Some others are easily skippable.</p>

<h3>David Bowie - The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars ★★★★★</h3>
<p>It's the best Bowie album of all time. You can't change my mind.</p>

<h3>Depeche Mode - Violator ★★★★★</h3>
<p>Favorite song: Enjoy the Silence</p>

<h3>Edie Brickell & The New Bohemians - Shooting Rubberbands at the Moon ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>What I Am is good but the rest of the album means nothing to me.</p>

<h3>Eurythmics - Revenge ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I can't remember any of this album despite having listened to it a few times.</p>

<h3>Howard Jones - The 12" Album ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>6 Very Good Songs</p>

<h3>Huey Lewis And The News - Sports ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I don't think there's anything I can complain about. I have the expanded one with Live versions, which I dislike.</p>

<h3>The Human League - Dare ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's decent!</p>

<h3>Incubus - Make Yourself ★★★★☆</h3>

<h3>Justin Bieber - My World 2.0 ★★★★★</h3>
<p>It's so cute! I love it. It's fun to sing and poppy! What more could you need in life?! HE'S SO CUTE</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - Believe ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Another great J Biebz album. Maria was a bad take. Favorite song: Thought of You</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - Purpose ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Still a good album, but on the decline. Favorite song: Been You (a Target exclusive?!)</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - Changes ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I'm not sure I liked any of the songs on this album. I was really excited for it too. I probably won't buy the next one.</p>

<h3>Justin Timberlake - Justified ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's catchy and good but is he allowed to sing that??? The lyrics are pretty spicy.</p>

<h3>Justin Timberlake - The 20/20 Experience ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>I spent many years never being able to get past Mirrors, but I eventually did and the rest of the album was good too. Favorite song: Mirrors</p>

<h3>Ke$ha - Warrior ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Fun beats but holy cow the whole album is a love letter to degeneracy.</p>

<h3>Milli Vanilli - Girl You Know It's True ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Nothing notable.</p>

<h3>Muse - Showbiz ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Unexciting album. Whiny voice and no bangers.</p>

<h3>Oingo Boingo - Only a Lad ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I think this one is just a little too silly for me.</p>

<h3>Savage Garden - Savage Garden ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I kept calling it the Jojo OST but I actually listened to it and then listened to it like 20 more times. I like in Santa Monica where he sings that you can be anyone you want on the phone. Same.</p>

<h3>Savage Garden - Affirmation ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Some good songs, some bad songs. There's a few that will make me mad to listen to but then there's The Best Thing, which I think is one of their top bangers. He was definitely divorce bitter at the time of writing this album.</p>

<h3>Seal - Seal (1991) ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>It's a really good one! I had a mix CD with Crazy on it back in the day and it's good to hear it again. I didn't originally like Killer, but I'm into it now.</p>

<h3>Seal - Seal (1994) ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Jesus Christ why did you name two albums the same thing. Whatever. They're both great. Favorite song: Kiss from a Rose (duh)</p>

<h3>Siouxsie and the Banshees - Peepshow ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>It's just so inoffensive. I don't even care.</p>

<h3>Staind - Dysfunction ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's a little rough but I still like it. F*ck hidden tracks.</p>

<h3>Staind - Break The Cycle ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Many fun songs to sing!</p>

<h3>Staind - 12 Shades of Grey  ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>This dude was hella upset about Layne Staley.</p>

<h3>Wang Chung - To Live And Die In L.A ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Vocal tracks (all 3 of them) are very good. Unfortunately there's only 3 of them.</p>
