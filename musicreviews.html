<h2>My Opinion is Law</h2>
<p>I said I wouldn't make a collection page for my CDs but I (or Ryan) do own all of these. I won't rate a greatest hits album here. That's cheating.</p>

<p>My opinion on compact discs: These are the best medium ever!!! Disc rot and children can happen, but these aren't destroyed by using them. They're easily rippable and probably the best quality you can get without stealing the master. These have become worthless in recent years, so stock up!</p>

<p>My opinion on vinyl records: why. Don't gimme dat.</p>

<p>If you don't enjoy new wave, nu metal, or anime bullsh*t, you're better off reading someone else's music reviews!</p>

<h3>98° - 98° And Rising ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>It's good but not too notable. Less overproduced than Backstreet Boys and NSYNC.</p>

<h3>A Change of Pace - An Offer You Can't Refuse ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>These guys are so upset. I love to hear it. I bought this at a Hot Topic after learning about them online. My mom's friend wanted to play my new CD in the car and I was so embarrassed. I'm still singing along all these years later.</p>

<h3>A.F.I. - Decemberunderground ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I'm pretty sure the lyrics are nonsense but this album is premium angst-filled men tier fun. I seriously love it.</p>

<h3>a-ha - Hunting High And Low ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I probably spent days listening to this album while sewing doll clothes as a teen.</p>

<h3>Ace of Base - The Sign ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I listen to it on repeat.</p>

<h3>Alphaville - Forever Young ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I expected all of the album to sound like Forever Young, but that's the slowest one on the album. Allegedly, there's a faster version of Forever Young out there. Please contact me if you have it. Favorite song: Fallen Angel</p>

<h3>Anberlin - Never Take Friendship Personal ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Emo, but I don't think anything was super degenerate. Singing about missing your late grandmother is nice. I like Stationary Stationery, The Runaways, The Feel Good Drag. Very singable.</p>

<h3>ATC - Planet Pop ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Very fun, would listen to many more times!</p>

<h3>Backstreet Boys - Millenium ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Premium boy band experience.</p>

<h3>Backstreet Boys - Black & Blue ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I love to start out an album listening to an unapologetic cheating song and then continuing to seemingly devoted love songs.</p>

<h3>BBMak - Sooner or Later ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I love these guys. If you love poppy boy bands too, give them a listen!!</p>

<h3>BIGBANG - ALIVE ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>It's really short! Only 7 tracks and one is an intro song. I haven't heard these songs in 10 years so it was nostalgic to hear them again. All the songs are pretty boppy and fun. Do I count as a kpopper now that I own this album? Favorite song: 사랑먼지 (Love Dust)</p>

<h3>Bjork - Post ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Delete "It's Oh So Quiet" before listening and you have a great album!</p>

<h3>Bush - Sixteen Stone ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Wow I already knew most of the songs from radio play. Lotta hits on this one. Not sure how some brits picked up the perfect grunge sound.</p>

<h3>Creed - Weathered ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>We had a ripped copy of this CD when I was a kid and I spent a lot of time making fun of it but it's really fun to sing.</p>

<h3>The Crow Soundtrack ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>The entire album is made by The Cure - Burn and NIN - Dead Souls. I don't know if either of these tracks were released elsewhere. These two are good enough to make up for the not great songs on the album.</p>

<h3>Cutting Crew - Broadcast ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>I keep getting them confused with Crowded House and The Outfield and I don't care much for Crowded House. This album is good though!</p>

<h3>Daft Punk - Random Access Memories ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>There's a few pretty good ones! I really like Fragments of Time, Doin' It Right, Instant Crush. Some others are easily skippable.</p>

<h3>David Bowie - The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars ★★★★★</h3>
<p>It's the best Bowie album of all time. You can't change my mind.</p>

<h3>Death Cab for Cutie - Kintsugi ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I was expecting emo when I saw the band name that I recognized and this is definitely not emo. Probably belongs next to Coldplay. It's fine but it's probably something your mom would listen to.</p>

<h3>Death Cab For Cutie - Narrow Stairs ☆☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I was so bored listening to this that I couldn't finish the album.</p>

<h3>Depeche Mode - Violator ★★★★★</h3>
<p>Favorite song: Enjoy the Silence</p>

<h3>Edie Brickell & The New Bohemians - Shooting Rubberbands at the Moon ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>What I Am is good but the rest of the album means nothing to me.</p>

<h3>Eiffel 65 - Europop (US Version) ★★★★★</h3>
<p>what is DUB in this life!?! I have NO idea!!!!</p>
<p>I have definitely overlistened to Blue, so I skip that one, but wowie zowie this CD is GOOD. I don't think there's a single song on this CD I don't love.</p>

<h3>Eurythmics - Revenge ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I can't remember any of this album despite having listened to it a few times.</p>

<h3>Fall Out Boy - From Under the Cork Tree ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Does it hold up? Yes.</p>

<h3>Fall Out Boy - Infinity on High ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Singles are good. The rest of the album is just okay.</p>

<h3>Fuel - Sunburn ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Shimmer is amazing. The rest is just okay.</p>

<h3>Fuel - Natural Selection ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Overall good!</p>

<h3>Goo Goo Dolls - A Boy Named Goo/Dizzy Up the Girl (hatmix) ★★★★★</h3>
<p>Delete tracks 2, 5, 8, 10, 13 on A Boy Name Goo and tracks 4, 7, 9, 12 on Dizzy up the Girl. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Hangry & Angry - Kill Me Kiss Me ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>This group is just a h.NAOTO publicity stunt but these songs are great. This EP contains 2 songs that aren't on the album.</p>

<h3>Hangry & Angry - Sadistic Dance ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Overall good, but I'm dropping a star because I don't like the "Crash Berlin" versions of the 3 songs from Kill Me Kiss Me as much as the EP mixes.</p>

<h3>Hinder - Take it to the Limit ☆☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Boring. Not even the singles are fun to listen to. I can't even figure out which are the singles without looking it up.</p>

<h3>Hoku - Hoku ☆☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I couldn't finish it. Terrible.</p>

<h3>The Honorary Title - Anything Else but the Truth ☆☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Acoustic emo is not my jam. Additionally, it sucks.</p>

<h3>Hoobastank - The Reason ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>These guys have a good sound!!! I avoided buying this for a while because I didn't want to listen to The Reason for the 700th time, but I caved and it was pretty good. Favorite track: Escape.</p>

<h3>Howard Jones - The 12" Album ★★★★★</h3>
<p>6 Very Good Songs</p>

<h3>Howard Jones - Cross That Line ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>There's some good songs but he's moving away from the new wave style I love so much.</p>

<h3>Howard Jones - In The Running ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>New wave is gone. It's just too slow for me. But! My copy is autographed. *__________*</p>

<h3>Howie Day - Australia ★★★★☆</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Howie Day - Stop All The World Now ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>He liked "She Says" so much that he rerecorded it!</p>

<h3>Huey Lewis And The News - Sports ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I don't think there's anything I can complain about. I have the expanded one with Live versions, which I dislike.</p>

<h3>Hum - You'd Prefer an Astronaut ★★★★☆</h3>

<h3>The Human League - Dare ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's decent!</p>

<h3>The Human League - Octopus ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>"Tell Me When" is a 5 star banger.</p>

<h3>Incubus - S.C.I.E.N.C.E. ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Extra funky style. They hadn't developed their iconic style yet.</p>

<h3>Incubus - Make Yourself ★★★★★</h3>
<p>Don't mind if I just delete Battlestar Scralatchtica....</p>

<h3>Incubus - A Crow Left of the Murder... ★★★★★</h3>

<h3>Incubus - Monuments and Melodies ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I'm generally choosing to not review compilation albums, but this one has some exclusives. Neither of Us can see is incredible. There's a duet version on the Stealth movie OST, but it's better as a Brandon solo. Every time I get to opening of "Let's Go Crazy", I think my playlist has switched to My Chemical Romance.</p>

<p>I don't own Morning View yet, but when I do, I will mention that I delete "Warning". It's on this album too, so here you go!</p>

<h3>Jonas Brothers - It's About Time ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>It's fine, I guess, but it's not good. One star for Year 3000, which is the best song on the album! Believe it or not, it's a cover.</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - My World ★★★★★</h3>
<p>Surely these albums aren't worth whatever happened to him as a child, but they are perfect.</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - My World 2.0 ★★★★★</h3>
<p>It's so cute! I love it. It's fun to sing and poppy! What more could you need in life?! HE'S SO CUTE</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - Believe ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Another great J Biebz album. Maria was a bad enough take that I'm dropping one star. Favorite song: Thought of You</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - Purpose ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Still a good album, but on the decline. Favorite song: Been You (a Target exclusive?!)</p>

<h3>Justin Bieber - Changes ☆☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I'm not sure I liked any of the songs on this album. I was really excited for it too. I won't buy the next one.</p>

<h3>Justin Timberlake - Justified ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's catchy and good but is he allowed to sing that??? The lyrics are pretty spicy.</p>

<h3>Justin Timberlake - The 20/20 Experience ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>I spent many years never being able to get past Mirrors, but I eventually did and the rest of the album was good too. Favorite song: Mirrors</p>

<h3>Ke$ha - Warrior ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Fun beats but holy cow the whole album is a love letter to degeneracy.</p>

<h3>The KLF - The White Room ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Scooter loves this band more than anyone else. The songs are good and the cult theme is good.</p>

<h3>Kon Kan - Syntonic ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>It's kind of boring.</p>

<h3>La Tour - La Tour ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Ryan will judge you if he walks in on you listening to "People Are Still Having Sex".</p>

<h3>Lenny Kravits - Lenny ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Actually yeah, let's get some more of this.</p>

<h3>Level 42 - Running in the Family ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Another one I've got on repeat!</p>

<h3>LFO - Life is Good ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>There's quite a bit of soulful singing in this. The overall feeling of this CD is more mature. West Side Story is the sound of the second album. "Baby Be Mine" samples "Human" by The Human League and it's pretty good.</p>

<h3>LFO - Life is Good ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Good boy band. Songs about making bad life choices. 98% of soulful singing is gone.</p>

<h3>Limp Bizkit - Significant Other ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Limp Bizkit - Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>The singles on this one are great. Listen to My Way and Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle) not (Urban Assault Vehicle).</p>

<h3>Mad at Gravity - Resonance ★★★★★</h3>
<p>Perfect. The only issue with this album is there's no second album. Favorite track: Kerosene</p>

<h3>Marilyn Manson - The Golden Age of Grotesque ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I can't stand the MM songs where he's just growling. The singles are listenable but I am not into it. If you want to watch him in twintails squirming almost naked (he has thigh highs on, he's not naked) on a couch, watch the video for Long Hard Road out of Hell.</p>

<h4>Bonus review of Doppelherz, a "film" included with the album (-1/5 stars)</h4>

<p>This is around 26 minutes of Mr. Manson repeating the same phrases over and over and over with repetitive and annoying background noise on loop. The visuals include two women strapped together, his band putting the two girls strapped together in the car on top of him, Manson watching the two girls strapped together in a bed, Manson putting on blackface and coming up with an excuse to say "sieg heil". I would find better entertainment in the homemade horror films of youtube circa 2007. There is nothing interesting about this "film". It's just drugs.</p>

<p>Diagnosis: This man has a terminal case of chuunibyou.</p>

<h3>Marilyn Manson - Eat Me, Drink Me ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>My favorite of the MM albums I have. Favorite track: Heart-Shaped Glasses</p>

<h3>Marilyn Manson - The Pale Emperor ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Do you think he survived his 7 day binge? I'm praying for him.</p>

<h3>Metric - Synthetica ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I am JAMMING to The Void!!!</p>

<h3>Michael Jackson - Thriller (25 Anniversary Edition) ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Original album: ★★★★☆ <br />
The remixes on this are absolutely god awful.</p>

<h3>Milli Vanilli - Girl You Know It's True ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Nothing notable.</p>

<h3>Muse - Showbiz ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Unexciting album. Whiny voice and no bangers.</p>

<h3>Muse - Absolution ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>I did not expect this one to be good after Showbiz but I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<h3>My Chemical Romance - Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>This is totally an album you'd expect me to like but I just don't care about it. I don't even want to sing along.</p>

<h3>The Neighborhood - I Love You ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>I hope this guy got the metal health help he needed after this album.</p>

<h3>Nena - Nena ★★★★☆</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>New Order - Republic ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I originally thought the album was really frontloaded, but I'm pretty sure the whole album is very good.</p>

<h3>Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Pretty neutral. I'm still shocked after hearing the uncensored version of Closer and I'm not sure why. What could I have possibly thought he was singing?!</p>

<h3>Nine Inch Nails - With Teeth ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Pretty good album. My favorite of the NIN ones I have. <s>Gonna think about changing this one to a 4 star.</s></p>

<h3>No Mercy - No Mercy ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Really fun and lots of Spanish guitar.</p>

<h3>Oasis - Be Here Now ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Catchy. Found myself singing along the first listen?</p>

<h3>Oingo Boingo - Only a Lad ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I think this one is just a little too silly for me.</p>

<h3>OneRepublic - Waking Up ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I downloaded this one as a teen so finding the CD and listening to it again is very nostalgic. How many hours did I listen to this while playing Sims 2?</p>

<h3>Panic! at the Disco - A Fever You Can't Sweat Out ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I'm still in love with all these years later.</p>

<h3>A Perfect Circle - Mer de noms ★★★★★</h3>
<p>Wowie this CD is good. Sleeping Beauty will always remind me of a Light x L fan flash that I'll never be able to link. I hope I saved it on my HDD! Update: I will never be able to watch this fan flash by go-devil-dante again and I am so upset about it.</p>

<h3>A Perfect Circle - Thirteenth Step ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I can't actually tell you what's on this CD because it's in the playlist right after the first one. I promise you the whole thing is a good time.</p>

<h3>A Perfect Circle - eMOTIVe ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Of course the next album would be neutral after hearing this one.</p>

<h3>A Perfect Circle - Eat the Elephant ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I think he forgot to put a banger in it. Very neutral.</p>

<h3>Pretenders - Pretenders ☆☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I don't know what I expected but I hate it.</p>

<h3>P.O.D - Satellite ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>I'm not sure I'm a fan of the reggae fusion tracks.</p>

<h3>Puddle of Mudd - Come Clean ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>I was way too old when I found out the song wasn't "she freakin blocked me".</p>

<h3>Robbie Williams - Rudebox ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>How many genres can you throw in one album? The two Pet Shop Boys songs are good!</p>

<h3>Ryuichi Sakamoto - BTTB ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>I am never in a piano mood. The version of Tong Poo is like going into the religious thrift store that only plays piano covers of popular music, but it's a weeaboo thrift store.</p>

<h3>Savage Garden - Savage Garden ★★★★★</h3>
<p>I kept calling it the Jojo OST but I actually listened to it and then listened to it like 20 more times. I like in Santa Monica where he sings that you can be anyone you want on the phone. Same.</p>

<h3>Savage Garden - Affirmation ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Some good songs, some bad songs. A lot of the lyrics make me want to bang my head on the desk. It would be really good if I didn't understand English. The Best Thing is on this album which I think is one of their top bangers. He was definitely divorce bitter and "exploring his sexuality" at the time of writing this album.</p>

<h3>Seal - Seal (1991) ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>It's a really good one! I had a mix CD with Crazy on it back in the day and it's good to hear it again. I didn't originally like Killer, but I'm into it now.</p>

<h3>Seal - Seal (1994) ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Jesus Christ why did you name two albums the same thing. Whatever. They're both great. Favorite song: Kiss from a Rose (duh)</p>

<h3>Silversun Pickups - Carnavas ★★★★★</h3>
<p>This is exactly what I'm looking for. I live for this sh*t. Stand out tracks: well thought out twinkles, little lover's so polite, dream at tempo 119</p>

<h3>Silversun Pickups - Swoon ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Not quite as perfect as their exceptional first album. Panic Switch is an absolute banger.</p>

<h3>Silversun Pickups - Neck of the Woods ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>They've moved away from shoegaze a lot now... Still good but the sound I love isn't there. Favorite track: Mean Spirits</p>

<h3>Siouxsie and the Banshees - Peepshow ☆☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>It's just so inoffensive. I don't even care.</p>

<h3>Skold Vs KMFDM - Skold Vs KMFDM ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Electronic industrial. It's like Marilyn Manson, but fun. This may be the most expensive CD I own.</p>

<h3>Smile Empty Soul - Smile Empty Soul ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Bottom of a Bottle is a 5 star banger!!!! Everything else is forgettable.</p>

<h3>Spin Doctors - Pocket Full of Kryptonite ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Funky guys!!</p>

<h3>Staind - Dysfunction ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>It's a little rough but I still like it. F*ck hidden tracks.</p>

<h3>Staind - Break The Cycle ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Many fun songs to sing!</p>

<h3>Staind - 12 Shades of Grey ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>This dude was hella upset about Layne Staley.</p>

<h3>The Strokes - Is This It ★★☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Did anyone else notice these guys and the Killers sound exactly the same? Nothing really stuck out to me.</p>

<h3>Tally Hall - Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>I bought this expecting the neocities babies to have terrible taste but I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<h3>Teddy Geiger - Underage Thinking ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
<p>Trash other than the singles.</p>

<h3>Tegan and Sara - Heartthrob ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Lesbian relationships sound super dramatic but make for a good album.</p>

<h3>Trapt - Someone in Control ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Ah! This album ended too quickly!!</p>

<h3>UNKLE - Psyence Fiction ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Another bought purely on the album art/genre. Definitely worth a few listens.</p>

<h3>Wang Chung - To Live And Die In L.A ★★★☆☆</h3>
<p>Vocal tracks are very good. Unfortunately there's only 3 of them.</p>

<h3>Yui - Can't Buy My Love ★★★★☆</h3>
<p>Fun and poppy jpop! I hadn't heard the songs before, but it makes me nostalgic for my early weeaboo days.</p>
