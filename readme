Hello! Welcome to HATSITE!

Most of this content is all made or written by me. Obviously, the photo(s) of me, my annoying stamp collection, buttons from other sites, official Volks graphics are not.

I can't give you permission to use those, but I hereby give you (the reader) permission to use anything else on my site, given you are not monetizing it or using it commercially.

If you steal my precious things, I will be sad, but I will get over it.

I hope you enjoy my site!
