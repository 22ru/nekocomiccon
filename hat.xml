            <description>Lots of changes to condense the cafe JS, but you hopefully won't notice.... New staff photos were chosen for a couple dolls. A review of my ACBJD order was added to the information page. A beautiful rendition of Hina was added to art for me page! Like 50000 new annoying stamps were added to my about page.</description>

            <link>https://hat.neocities.org/home.html#123</link>
            <description>I hope you didn't notice I missed 2 questions in the 2022 BJD Questionnaire! I definitely did not miss 55 and 77! I went through my doll blog log after discovering a small group of bloggers still left on Blogspot. I got a few more in there and moved around the ones that died in the last few months. RIP. I added a CSS file for this RSS feed. Why didn't anyone tell me RSS was awesome??</description>
