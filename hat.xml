            <description>I hope you didn't notice I missed 2 questions in the 2022 BJD Questionnaire! I definitely did not miss 55 and 77! I went through my doll blog log after discovering a small group of bloggers still left on Blogspot. I got a few more in there and moved around the ones that died in the last few months. RIP. I added a CSS file for this RSS feed. Why didn't anyone tell me RSS was awesome??</description>
