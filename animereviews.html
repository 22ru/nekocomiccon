<h2>anime</h2>

<p>I really dont have much to say about anime</p>

<h3>Asobi Asobase</h3>
<p>It had some very good points, specifically Fujiwara's gag. The rest isn't particularly memorable.</p>

<h3>Clannad</h3>
<p>It's okay. I won't write home about it but I enjoyed it.</p>

<h3>Clannad After Story</h3>
<p>I wrote home about it. The real sh*t starts here. Clannad itself is just worldbuilding.</p>

<h3>Di Gi Charat</h3>
<p>The original unattractive aidoru. Lots of toilet humor.</p>

<h3>Eureka seveN</h3>
<p>I loved this show in middle school and rewatched it in 2021 (over like a week too). It was so much fun! Some parts were slow but power through! Holland is still on my crush list 15 years later. Oh my god.</p>

<h3>Evangelion Rebuild movies</h3>
<p>Shinji died for your sins.</p>

<h3>Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya</h3>
<p>It was cute but I felt like the FBI was going to break down my door for watching it. I didn't continue past season 1 because of it. This is the only fate media I have ever consumed and I'm going to keep it that way.</p>

<h3>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Childen</h3>
<p>It's very pretty but what is the plot???</p>

<h3>Fruits Basket</h3>
<p>I could not stop watching!! I enjoy this show so much!! WHY did they cut it off so early though?! I will have to read the manga...</p>

<p>I'm really upset Hatori is 27. He is far too old to be 27.</p>

<p>Momiji is undeniably best boy!!!!</p>

<h3>Gochiusa</h3>
<p>I don't think these girls have more than 5 braincells but god they are cute.</p>

<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/l_fIWlu5zuo?t=31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gosick</a></h3>
<p>Tiny girl with slightly above average intelligence amazes everyone (very low IQ) with some basic reasoning skills. None of the mysteries are tough, so please enjoy with your love for cuteness. They are very cute!</p>
<p>I love detectives, blondes, cute girls, cute boys, love stories, and big dresses, so everything about this anime is right up my alley. Now I want both the Kazuya and Victorique dollfies.</p>

<h3>Hanayamata</h3>
<p>Ryan bought this one for almost nothing on BD and gave it a chance because I love cute girls in kimono. It was cute!</p>
<p>I don't know why there's magic going on in the first episode because it doesn't continue. The animators really did their best to avoid animating any dancing. I still have no idea what yosakoi dancing looks like.</p>
<p>I like Hana and Naru's dad. The writer didn't bother to research American weeaboos very much so Hana isn't real life accurate. Also who tf has the last name "Fountainstand"???? There's a little drama, but it's kept short.</p>

<h3>Higurashi no Naku Koro ni</h3>
<p>This proves you dont have to be good at anything to make a hit series. I had fun watching it!</p>

<h3>Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation</h3>
<p>It wasn't good. I'd actually describe it as "bad".</p>

<h3>the iDolM@sTer (2011)</h3>
<p>These girls are wonderful and I love them.</p>

<h3>The Idolmaster Cinderlla Girls</h3>
<p>This "producer" is the most socially retarded man I've ever seen on the big screen. I know he's just a self insert but jesus he's not a character.</p>
<p>I like how they picked the most maladjusted characters for the main cast.</p>
<p>Can we get ARM to make some new imas tunes again??</p>
<p>Nina is my favorite girl and Nation Blue is the best song that appears in the show.</p>

<h3>Infinite Stratos</h3>
<p>Basic harem anime. Boring. Groanworthy. I almost didn't finish it.</p>

<h3>Joshiraku</h3>
<p>5 idiots discuss nothing important. Would recommend!</p>

<h3>K-on!</h3>
<p>If you haven't seen this wtf are you doing. Best anime of all time. I cry every time.</p>

<h3>Kakushigoto</h3>
<p>One man destroys himself trying to hide something insignificant. Probably an autobiography. The manga is exactly the same as the anime so take your pick of medium. I love this show.</p>

<p>If you hate all the gags from SZS, this one may be safe for you. It's a lot more wholesome and still has all the fun of Kumeta's art style!</p>

<h3>Kuragehime</h3>
<p>A story about women who learn they are beautiful. Pick up the manga where the anime leaves off! The anime ending was abrupt and didn't actually solve any of the problems.</p>

<h3>Kyoukai no Kanata</h3>
<p>I don't remember much about this show but every time the idol scene shows up on openings.moe I think "this show was f*cking stupid".</p>
<p>Girls were cute though! As usual for a Kyoani.</p>

<h3>Listen to Me, Girls. I Am Your Father!</h3>
<p>I cant believe i got through 2 episodes of this. Exactly as bad as the title implies.</p>

<h3>Love Live Season 1</h3>
<p>I've never felt more infurated by an anime before. Honestly it was pretty impressive! Don't forget to give up your dreams to play make believe in high school my dudes.</p>

<h3>Lucky Star</h3>
<p>God, I love Minoru Shiraishi. Best EDs were every one he sang on the cliffside.</p>

<h3>Mawaru Penguindrum</h3>
<p>Make Terrorists Hot Again</p>
<p>Guess my penguindrum crush. I dare you.</p>
<p>Before K-on, this was my favorite anime.</p>

<h3>Monogatari series</h3>
<p>How could they make an anime just about talking interesting to watch? Well, they did. My favorite girl is Hachikuji. I started watching this show 3 times before I actually made it to episode 5. After that, I was hooked.</p>
<p>The best OP was Koimonogatari (Duet Version).</p>

<h3>Neon Genesis Evangelion</h3>
<p>Shinji-kun has got it rough. I like Kaworu. He's cute!</p>

<h3>New Game</h3>
<p>A show that makes me wish I had a job at an extremely sexist game studio. I ALSO want to only employ cute girls. Not as much drama as working with real life 19 year olds. Oddly enough, they don't hang out a ton outside of work. But they also never leave work so I guess that makes sense. </p>

<p>It was sad to see some corporate f*ckery screw Aoba over. Life isn't all donuts and rice crackers after all.</p>

<p>The number of fanservice shots is far too high once you start season 2. I do NOT want to see the girls' crotches that much THANK YOU. Hajime could also use a little more clothes but at least they made a joke about that. There's a pretty undeniable yuri crush/relationship but nothing offensive to people who aren't into yuri.</p>

<p>Maybe I don't want to work at Eagle Jump after all... but I am ready for season 3!! Soujirou best boy.</p>

<h3>Nichijou</h3>
<p>A+</p>

<h3>Non Non Biyori</h3>
<p>Classic slice of life! Good old times out in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<h3>Pani Poni Dash</h3>
<p>Mesousa is best boy!!!! Very stupid show. Would recommend to lovers of stupidity.</p>

<h3>Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei</h3>
<p>This anime was a really good time, even with all the panty gags. It's very sad they did not finish it. Shaft can let their animators go nuts all they want imo. I love how they stayed consistent with Kumeta's style.</p>
<p>Awesome OPs and EDs. Probably some of the top ones of all time. The Ootsuki Kenji songs are all great.</p>

<h3>Seirei no Moribito</h3>
<p>I normally don't watch MPREG, but I think this one was very good! I sang the OP every time to Ryan's dismay. A few months after watching, I still am hoping to see what happens next while preparing dinner and am sad every time I realize it's over.</p>

<h3>Shoujo Kakumei Utena</h3>
<p>Jesus Chrust how many times have I watched the same cels be reused with different voice script. This anime would have been worth watching if it was a 1/3rd of the length.</p>

<h3>Toradora!</h3>
<p>Greatest love story ever told. Is that the meme, right?? I like his mom.</p>
<p>But seriously I do like this show a lot.</p>

<h3>Violet Evergarden</h3>
<p>I'm pretty sure I cried every episode. I will not show this to Ryan or watch it with anyone around.</p>

<h3>Yuri on Ice</h3>
<p>I was not prepared for what was going to happen.</p>

<h3>Yurikuma Arashi</h3>
<p>After I got past the "gaogao", I enjoyed it.</p>

<h3>Yuyushiki</h3>
<p>3 dumb girls google things in a small room. Tsukkomi girl is more enjoyable than the average tsukkomi! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9baMglr1io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Now available on bluray and dvd!</a></p>

<h3>Watamote</h3>
<p>This anime made me cry multiple times because I was laughing so hard. Tomoko messes up social interactions so badly and it reminds me of my youth.</p>

<h3>Wake Up, Girls! Seven Idols</h3>
<p>A lot of build up for many unfortunate panty shots I could only feel bad about seeing.</p>

<h3>Wake Up, Girls! (TV)</h3>
<p>Teen girl drama, many girls with names I can't recall, disgusting wotagei guys. Manager and boss were kind of boring.</p>
<p>They did not make the idol industry look pleasant at all. Finally the world learns that idols are just exploited girls! Oh wait, no one watched this.</p>

<h3>When Marnie Was There</h3>
<p>Is Marnie like an actual name?? I've never met anyone named Marnie in my life. It was a cute movie and Sayaka was the best character. I had to roll my eyes when they had to spell out the twist.</p>

<h3>Working!!</h3>
<p>This anime inspired me to get a job. The anime makes it look more fun than it is.</p>

<h3>The World Only God Knows</h3>
<p>Imagine Light Yagami playing a visual novel on a firetruck. Elsie is the best imouto <3 </p>
