<h2>anime</h2>

<p>i really dont have much to say about anime</p>

<h3>Clannad</h3>
<p>its okay. i wont write home about it but i enjoyed it.</p>

<h3>Clannad After Story</h3>
<p>i wrote home about it. the real sh*t starts here</p>

<h3>Eureka seveN</h3>
<p>i loved this show in middle school and rewatched it in 2021 (in like a week too). it was so much fun! some parts were slow but power through! holland is still on my crush list 15 years later.</p>

<h3>Evangelion Rebuild movies</h3>
<p>well that was exciting</p>

<h3>Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya</h3>
<p>it was cute but i felt like a pedo for watching it. didn't keep going past season 1 because of it. this is the only fate media i have ever consumed and i'm going to keep it that way</p>

<h3>Gochiusa</h3>
<p>i dont think these girls have more than 5 braincells but god they are cute</p>

<h3>Higurashi no Naku Koro ni</h3>
<p>this proves you dont have to be good at anything to make a hit series. i had fun watching it!</p>

<h3>Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation</h3>
<p>it wasnt good.</p>

<h3>the iDolM@sTer (2011)</h3>
<p>these girls are wonderful and i love them</p>

<h3>Infinite Stratos</h3>
<p>basic harem anime. boring. groanworthy.</p>

<h3>Joshiraku</h3>
<p>5 idiots discuss nothing important. would recommend</p>

<h3>K-on!</h3>
<p>if you haven't seen this wtf are you doing. best anime of all time. I cry every time.</p>

<h3>Kakushigoto</h3>
<p>one man destroys himself trying to hide something insignificant. probably an autobiography. the manga is exactly the same as the anime so take your pick of medium. i love this show.</p>

<h3>Kuragehime</h3>
<p>a story about women who learn they are beautiful. pick up the manga where the anime leaves off! the anime ending was abrupt and didn't actually solve any of the problems...</p>

<h3>Kyoukai no Kanata</h3>
<p>I don't remember much about this show but every time the idol scene shows up on openings.moe i think "this show was f*cking stupid"</p>
<p>girls were cute though! as usual for a kyoani</p>

<h3>Listen to Me, Girls. I Am Your Father!</h3>
<p>i cant believe i got through 2 episodes of this. exactly as bad as the title implies.</p>

<h3>Love Live Season 1</h3>
<p>i've never been more infurated by an ending before. honestly it was pretty impressive! don't forget to give up your dreams to play make believe in high school my dudes.</p>

<h3>Lucky Star</h3>
<p>god i love minoru shiraishi</p>

<h3>Mawaru Penguindrum</h3>
<p>"make terrorists hot again"</p>
<p>guess my penguindrum crush. i dare you.</p>

<h3>Monogatari series</h3>
<p>how could they make an anime just about talking interesting to watch? well they did. my favorite girl is hachikuji.</p>

<h3>Nichijou</h3>
<p>A+</p>

<h3>Non Non Biyori</h3>
<p>classic slice of life! good old times out in the middle of nowhere</p>

<h3>Shoujo Kakumei Utena</h3>
<p>jesus chrust how many times have i watched the same cels be reused with different voice script. this anime would have been worth watching if it was a 1/3rd of the length.</p>

<h3>Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei</h3>
<p>this anime was a pretty good time</p>
<p>awesome OPs and EDs. probably some of the top ones of all time</p>

<h3>Violet Evergarden</h3>
<p>im pretty sure i cried every episode. i will not show this to ryan or watch it with anyone around.</p>

<h3>Yuri on Ice</h3>
<p>i was not prepared for what was going to happen.</p>

<h3>Watamote</h3>
<p>this anime made me cry multiple times because i was laughing so hard.</p>
