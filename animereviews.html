<h2>anime</h2>

<p>i really dont have much to say about anime</p>

<h3>Asobi Asobase</h3>
<p>it had some very good points, specifically fujiwara's gag. the rest isnt particularly memorable.</p>

<h3>Clannad</h3>
<p>its okay. i wont write home about it but i enjoyed it.</p>

<h3>Clannad After Story</h3>
<p>i wrote home about it. the real sh*t starts here</p>

<h3>Di Gi Charat</h3>
<p>the original unattractive aidoru. lots of toilet humor.</p>

<h3>Eureka seveN</h3>
<p>i loved this show in middle school and rewatched it in 2021 (in like a week too). it was so much fun! some parts were slow but power through! holland is still on my crush list 15 years later.</p>

<h3>Evangelion Rebuild movies</h3>
<p>Shinji died for your sins.</p>

<h3>Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya</h3>
<p>it was cute but i felt like a pedo for watching it. didn't keep going past season 1 because of it. this is the only fate media i have ever consumed and i'm going to keep it that way</p>

<h3>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Childen</h3>
<p>It's very pretty but what is the plot???</p>

<h3>Gochiusa</h3>
<p>i dont think these girls have more than 5 braincells but god they are cute</p>

<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/tVcfZEE7U2s?t=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gosick</a></h3>
<p>tiny girl with slightly above average intelligence amazes everyone with some basic reasoning skills.</p>
<p>i love detectives, cute girls, cute boys, love stories, and big dresses, so everything about this anime is right up my alley. now i want both the kazuya and victorique dollfies</p>

<h3>Higurashi no Naku Koro ni</h3>
<p>this proves you dont have to be good at anything to make a hit series. i had fun watching it!</p>

<h3>Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation</h3>
<p>it wasnt good.</p>

<h3>the iDolM@sTer (2011)</h3>
<p>these girls are wonderful and i love them</p>

<h3>The Idolmaster Cinderlla Girls</h3>
<p>this "producer" is the most socially retarded man ive ever seen on the big screen. i know hes just a self insert but jesus hes not a character.</p>
<p>i like how they picked the most maladjusted characters for the main cast</p>
<p>can we get ARM to make some new imas tunes again??</p>
<p>nina is my favorite girl and nation blue is probably the best song that appears in the show</p>

<h3>Infinite Stratos</h3>
<p>basic harem anime. boring. groanworthy.</p>

<h3>Joshiraku</h3>
<p>5 idiots discuss nothing important. would recommend</p>

<h3>K-on!</h3>
<p>if you haven't seen this wtf are you doing. best anime of all time. I cry every time.</p>

<h3>Kakushigoto</h3>
<p>one man destroys himself trying to hide something insignificant. probably an autobiography. the manga is exactly the same as the anime so take your pick of medium. i love this show.</p>

<p>if you hate all the gags from SZS, this one may be safe for you. it's a lot more wholesome. Still has all the fun of Kumeta's art style!</p>

<h3>Kuragehime</h3>
<p>a story about women who learn they are beautiful. pick up the manga where the anime leaves off! the anime ending was abrupt and didn't actually solve any of the problems...</p>

<h3>Kyoukai no Kanata</h3>
<p>I don't remember much about this show but every time the idol scene shows up on openings.moe i think "this show was f*cking stupid"</p>
<p>girls were cute though! as usual for a kyoani</p>

<h3>Listen to Me, Girls. I Am Your Father!</h3>
<p>i cant believe i got through 2 episodes of this. exactly as bad as the title implies.</p>

<h3>Love Live Season 1</h3>
<p>i've never been more infurated by an ending before. honestly it was pretty impressive! don't forget to give up your dreams to play make believe in high school my dudes.</p>

<h3>Lucky Star</h3>
<p>god i love minoru shiraishi. Best EDs were every one he sang on the cliffside.</p>

<h3>Mawaru Penguindrum</h3>
<p>"make terrorists hot again"</p>
<p>guess my penguindrum crush. i dare you.</p>
<p>before keion, this was my favorite anime</p>

<h3>Monogatari series</h3>
<p>how could they make an anime just about talking interesting to watch? well they did. my favorite girl is hachikuji.</p>
<p>The best OP was Koimonogatari (Duet Version).</p>

<h3>Neon Genesis Evangelion</h3>
<p>shinji-kun has got it rough. i like kaworu. hes cute</p>

<h3>New Game</h3>
<p>A show that makes me wish I had a job at an extremely sexist game studio. I ALSO want to only employ cute girls. Not as much drama as working with real life 19 year olds. Oddly enough, they don't hang out a ton outside of work. But they also never leave work so I guess that makes sense. </p>

<p>It was sad to see some corporate f*ckery screw Aoba over. Life isn't all donuts and rice crackers after all.</p>

<p>The number of fanservice shots is far too high once you start season 2. I do NOT want to see the girls' crotches that much THANK YOU. Hajime could also use a little more clothes but at least they made a joke about that. There's a pretty undeniable yuri crush/relationship but nothing offensive to people who aren't into yuri.</p>

<p>Maybe I don't want to work at Eagle Jump after all... but I am ready for season 3!! Soujirou best boy</p>

<h3>Nichijou</h3>
<p>A+</p>

<h3>Non Non Biyori</h3>
<p>classic slice of life! good old times out in the middle of nowhere</p>

<h3>Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei</h3>
<p>this anime was a really good time. even with all the panty gags. it's very sad they did not finish it. Shaft can let their animators go nuts all they want imo. i love how they stayed consistent with kumeta's style.</p>
<p>awesome OPs and EDs. probably some of the top ones of all time. the ootsuki kenji songs are all great</p>

<h3>Seirei no Moribito</h3>
<p>i normally don't watch MPREG but I think this one was fun to watch! I sang the OP every time to ryans dismay. a few months after watching i still am hoping to see what happens next while preparing dinner and am sad every time i realize it's over.</p>

<h3>Shoujo Kakumei Utena</h3>
<p>jesus chrust how many times have i watched the same cels be reused with different voice script. this anime would have been worth watching if it was a 1/3rd of the length.</p>

<h3>Toradora!</h3>
<p>greatest love story ever told. is that the meme right?? i like his mom.</p>
<p>but seriously i do like this show a lot</p>

<h3>Violet Evergarden</h3>
<p>im pretty sure i cried every episode. i will not show this to ryan or watch it with anyone around.</p>

<h3>Yuri on Ice</h3>
<p>i was not prepared for what was going to happen.</p>

<h3>Yurikuma Arashi</h3>
<p>after i got past the "gaogao" i enjoyed it</p>

<h3>Yuyushiki</h3>
<p>3 girls learn how to google. now available on bluray and dvd</p>

<h3>Watamote</h3>
<p>this anime made me cry multiple times because i was laughing so hard.</p>

<h3>When Marnie Was There</h3>
<p>Is Marnie like an actual name?? I've never met anyone named Marnie in my life. It was a cute movie and Sayaka was the best character. I had to roll my eyes when they had to spell out the twist.</p>

<h3>Working!!</h3>
<p>this anime inspired me to get a job. the anime makes it look more fun than it is.</p>

<h3>The World Only God Knows</h3>
<p>imagine Light Yagami playing a visual novel on a firetruck. Elsie is the best imouto <3 </p>
