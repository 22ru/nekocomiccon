<h2>an ever expanding furby collection (dangerous)</h2>

<img src="img/furby/LOL00572.jpg">

<p>I have so many of these things. I have had to force myself to stop buying every one I see. I have no more room in my home. Please help.</p>


<h3>Furby 1998</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2* Leopard</li>
    <p>My first furby was a Leopard furby! I have two now and you can only tell them apart because my original furby is a mute.</p>

    <li>Snowball (in box)</li>

    <li>Wolf (in box)</li>

    <li>2* Witch's Cat</li>
    <p>My aunt bought a furby and didn't like it so she gave it to me and my sister. Another one was found at a thrift store and given to Ryan.</p>

    <li>Skunk</li>
    <p>My friend has this furby. I hope he is keeping it safe!</p>

    <li>2* Dalmation</li>
    <p>One of these was my sister's original furby. I imagine it was the dirtier one.</p>

    <li>2* Tiger</li>
    <p>The one with green eyes was given to me by my cousins who hated their furby. I had made him a little wizard cloak out of felt. The brown eyed one is likely from a yard sale.</p>

    <li>Coffee</li>
    <p>Such a cute color! Unfortunately this furby does not work.</p>

    <li>Lizard</li>

    <li>Spring Time (in box)</li>
    <p>Somehow my mother was able to keep this furby boxed in a house with 2 children. Not sure how.</p>

    <li>Graduation</li>
    <p>This furby graduated with honors.</p>

    <li>Millennium</li>
    <p>Given to me by a doll friend in 2014 after a doll road trip where my obsession was revealed.</p>

    <li>Shelby Blue Moon</li>
    <p>My original Shelby! I've never actually seen more.</p>

    <li>Shelby Aqua Marine</li>
    <p>My imouto's Shelby!</p>

    <li>Gizmo</li>
    <p>Found at a yard sale!</p>
</ul>

<p>When my first furby quit talking, I got a furby baby. I was so unhappy with it that I ended up returning it. I never got another!</p>

<h3>Furby 2005</h3>

<p>I don't own and have never seen one of these in real life. I do own an unopened puzzle though.</p>

<p>This release is so strange. The beak and eyelids appear to degrade on them. I can't help but dream of owning one.</p>

<h3>Furby 2012</h3>

<p>I really wanted "Festive Sweater" but I never ended up getting one! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7wSHU-BTNLs" target="_blank">I have official furby cigarettes!!</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>Yeti</li>
    <p>You bet I fought someone for this furby on black friday 2012 at Walmart! I have the box.</p>
    <li>Taboo</li>
    <li>Green Man</li>

    <li>Polka Dots</li>
    <p>Another furby I got on black friday at Walmart. I have the box for this one.</p>
    <li>Triangles</li>

    <li>Party Rockers Twittby</li>
    <p>I think I got this guy for Christmas in 2013 from a good friend. I'm fairly sure I have his box.</p>

    <li>Furbling Blue Diamonds</li>
    <p>A Christmas gift from someone I used to know. I have the box.</p>
    <li>Furbling Crystal pink-purple</li>
    <p>Same as above. I have the box.</p>

    <li>Furbacca</li>
    <p>Found at a Goodwill for $8 on 6/30/2022. Doesn't work ;a;</p>
</ul>

<h3>Furby Connect</h3>

<p>This release is too cute!! I may be alone in having that opinion. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPPse5nio80" target="_blank">I love them!</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>Coral</li>
    <p>My imouto ordered one of these off Amazon for me when they were released. The pink one was unavailable at the time.</p>

    <li>Pink</li>
    <p>Found on clearance at walmart for $25 on 6/2/2017. My heart!</p>
