<h2>short food + drink reviews</h2>

<h3>teas</h3>

	<h4>Czar Nikolas II Nostalgia</h4>
	<p>i used to joke about this drink being nostalgic 15 years ago and now it is nostalgic. it tastes mostly like their normal black but has a flowery/strawberry taste</p>

	<h4>Czar Nikolas II Black</h4>
	<p>ryan can't stop drinking this</p>

	<h4>Romanov Tea Anastasia</h4>
	<p>so pretty, so rosy!</p>

	<h4>Tiesta Nutty Almond Cream</h4>
	<p>uh this is just honey bunches of oats with almonds. luckily i love honey bunches of oats with almonds.</p>

	<h4>Tiesta Blueberry Wild Child</h4>
	<p>i bought some "blueberry delight" at marketspice for a high price and then i found this which is almost exactly the same. good deal.</p>

	<h4>MarketSpice Huckleberry's Special Mix (PLU 8371)</h4>
	<p>big fan of this one. everyone asks me "whats this delicious tea you made?" whenever i make a pot of it</p>

<h3>soda pops</h3>
	<h4>root beer</h4>
	<p>this is the best pop. there are none better. stop looking.</p>

<h3>hot sauce / seasonings</h3>

	<h4>Texas Pete</h4>
	<p>its the perfect hot sauce. i love cowboys.</p>

	<h4>tony charonie's</h4>
	<p>it says "great on everything" and it's not lying</p>

	<h4>lowry's seasoning spice</h4>
	<p>put it on your cottage cheese. trust me.</p>

<h3>vegetables</h3>

	<h4>broccoli</h4>
	<p>now this is a good one. i love to eat it</p>

	<h4>zucchini</h4>
	<p>i cut mine into strips and season them with tony charonie's and grease and bake them for 30 min at 400 degrees. i tell myself they are french fries.</p>

	<h4>green onions</h4>
	<p>quite good!!!! lately ive started cutting some up on my breakfasts</p>

	<h4>sweet onions</h4>
	<p>i will eat these raw</p>

	<h4>tomatoes</h4>
	<p>i dont really like these. heirloom tomatoes are good, but every day store bought tomatoes kinda suck. cherry tomatoes are only good because they're fun to eat</p>

	<h4>cauliflower</h4>
	<p>never really got into this one. tastes good when you cook it in vinegar but what doesnt?</p>

	<h4>acorn squash</h4>
	<p>i never leave it in the oven long enough, but when i do, its very delicious</p>

<h3>fruits</h3>

	<h4>peaches</h4>
	<p>it doesnt get better than this</p>

	<h4>bosc pears</h4>
	<p>ugly colored pears taste best. forget the other varieties!</p>

	<h4>pineapple</h4>
	<p>im sure we all know the controversial question "does pinapple belong on pizza?" the real answer is it doesnt f*ckin matter because pineapple doesnt belongin existence.</p>

<h3>milk and milk substitutes</h3>

	<h4>milk</h4>
	<p>i buy whole milk a whole lot</p>

	<h4>chocolate soy milk</h4>
	<p>doesnt taste like chocomi but it sure is good</p>

	<h4>almond milk</h4>
	<p>i might as well put water in my cereal if this is my only option. waste of money</p>

	<h4>heavy whipping cream</h4>
	<p>now we're talking. i pour a little bit in my black tea and rooibos for a good time</p>

	<h4>half n half</h4>
	<p>offers no advantage over heavy cream other than price</p>

	<h4>zoi greek yogurt (traditional plain)</h4>
	<p>best greek yogurt ive found so far. i love the texture</p>

	<h4>Drunken Goat cheese</h4>
	<p>i refuse to believe there's a cheese better than this.</p>

	<h4>Brie</h4>
	<p>looks like mold, tastes like mold, yet i cant stop eating it</p>

	<h4>Tickler cheese</h4>
	<p>actually this one might be the best cheese. im not sure anymore</p>
