<h2>short food + drink reviews</h2>

<h3>teas</h3>

<h4>Czar Nikolas II Nostalgia</h4>
<p>i used to joke about this drink being nostalgic 15 years ago and now it is nostalgic. it tastes mostly like their normal black but has a flowery/strawberry taste</p>

<h4>Czar Nikolas II Black</h4>
<p>ryan can't stop drinking this</p>

<h4>Romanov Tea Anastasia</h4>
<p>so pretty, so rosy!</p>

<h4>Tiesta Nutty Almond Cream</h4>
<p>uh this is just honey bunches of oats with almonds. luckily i love honey bunches of oats with almonds.</p>

<h4>Tiesta Blueberry Wild Child</h4>
<p>i bought some "blueberry delight" at marketspice for a high price and then i found this which is almost exactly the same. good deal.</p>

<h3>hot sauce</h3>

<h4>Texas Pete</h4>
<p>its the perfect hot sauce. i love cowboys.</p>
