	<h2>acquisition syndrome: art style</h2>

    <p></p>
    <h3>Analog</h3>
    <h4>Inks</h4>
    <p>I have 3 scented fountain pen inks from Herbin. Violet is light sensitive. I haven't noticed issues with cocoa and rose yet, but I haven't tested them either. These are much more water resistant thank Parker Quink and will not move as nicely with water. Lines remain if you apply a water brush to them. I see no dye separation with rose. These inks are not interesting visually, but they do smell nice.</p>
    <p>I got a big bottle of Parker Twink black on clearance at Staples of all places and it is great for ink paintings. It fully dissolves with a water brush.</p>
    <p>Deleter Black 4 is allegedly water and copic proof. I highly disagree. Be careful not to wipe at this while wet because it will smear! I hate using this ink. It's a pain to clean and it's not anything proof. I don't recommend it.</p>
    <p>I frequenly use Sakura Gelly Roll in white in all 3 sizes. Another favorite is Stardust clear for a touch of glitter. The glitter does come off a bit when you touch it.</p>
    <p>I own a white POSCA marker but it explodes every time I use it. I don't use it.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy copics for their super brush nibs. Other brands may also have brush tips, but I haven't found one that beats copic. </p>

    <h4>Paints</h4>
    <p>I'm using the Holbein Irodori gouache summer set. I like the color choices and would happily buy the other season sets.</p>

    <p>I was very lucky to have found a small set of Daniel Smith watercolor tubes for almost no money. I have Lunar Black, French Ultramarine, Perylene Red, Hansa Yellow Medium. As much as I would have liked a CMYK instead, this is a nice little set!</p>

    <p>Do not ever buy the Artsmith gouache set. They stained my doll and my palette. Trash.</p>

    <h4>Paper</h4>
    <p>I haven't tried many sketchbooks, but I do like the Strathmore 300 and 400 series in sizes 9x12 inch and above. Above is a little hard to bring with you, but 9x12 is pretty comfortable.</p>
    <p>In a moment of desperation, I purchased a Koh-i-noor 9x12 with removable pages. The paper is a little too thin for my tastes, but the killer is "removable pages" which get caught in your sleeves and pulled up as you draw. </p>
    <p>For notebooks, Leuchtturm 1917 paper can hold up against both fountain pens and light watercoloring. Moleskine does not hold up to either. I have no idea how Moleskine has a following. Their paper is not nice.</p>

    <h4>Pencils</h4>
    <p>I love lead holders due to me never wanting to sharpen pencils. I like the Koh-I-Noor Technigraph 5611 because it's metal and sturdy. I use Staedtler refills.</p>
    <p>I was gifted a pack of Tombow Mono HB Pencils and they're very nice. The only problem is you have to sharpen them! Once in a while, I'll hit a scratchy spot in the lead</p>

    <h4>Erasers</h4>
    <p>I'm a big fan of Sakura arch foam, Pentel Click Eraser ZE23. Foam erases very well. I tried switching to another, then came back to foam and realized how badly the other sucked. Click Eraser does not erase nicely, but is great for tight spaces.</p>

    <h4>Pens</h4>
    <p>My favorite of the fountain pens I have bought is my Lamy Safari F. I enjoy writing with it more than I do drawing.</p>
    <p>I do not like the Preppy at ALL. I bought 2 and both of their barrels cracked within 2 months. Both 03 and 02 clog with any ink that is not black. I taped up a barrel and am using 02 with black at times.</p>
    <p>I love using Sailor Compass Fude De Mannen 40 degree for drawing! The fude nib is great for line variation.</p>
    <p>My Rotring rapidograph 0.35 dries out so quickly. I don't think this thing is even remotely airtight. It produces the finest lines ever when it does work!</p>

    <!---------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3>Digital</h3>

    <p>My art program of choice is Krita due to limited Linux options. It's much easier to use than GIMP. I still use GIMP as well because there are places where Krita is lacking.</p>

    <img src="img/LOL05298.jpg" />

    <p>I have a Wacom Cintiq 16 propped up on a <a href="https://www.art-alternatives.com/napa-table-easel-and-book-stand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">table top easel</a> similar to this. The cable is 72 inches long and this is NOT in the specs. I would have appreciated if it was a bit longer. I use the xsetwacom drivers with default settings. If you're confused about Bezier curve values and want to adjust them, check out this <a href="https://linuxwacom.github.io/bezier.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site</a>.</p>

    <p>I sometimes have an issue where the cursor freezes. This is annoying but easily fixed by turning the pen around to the eraser and then back. The first line drawn when switching from another program to Krita will be messed up. Click on the program outside the drawing range before drawing. I don't know where the issue lies between Krita, drivers, or the tablet.</p>

    <p>I highly recommend a remote for your tablet. I'm using a right joycon with some slight drift, which makes it annoying to use with my switch. I connect to it using blueman and use <a href="https://github.com/22ru/chiizukeiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chiizukeiki</a> to map the buttons. There is a <a href="https://github.com/22ru/chiizukeiki/tree/master/notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">folder of notes</a> on this which you are welcome to read and try to adapt the program to your own needs.</p>

    <p>This set up is not nearly as simple and easy as on Windows. It can be a struggle. It's a labor of love for Linux. Or distaste for Windows past 7?</p>

    <p>I do use an art glove with my tablet. At first I was just larping, but the side of my palm started sticking on the surface when I lost it and I now appreciate it a lot. You can make one of these very easily by tracing your hand on jersey knit fabric and doing just a little sewing.</p>

    <p>Are you still a beginner at learning how to draw? I highly recommend not practicing on a digital tablet. Your perfect line that you undid 50 times over 30 minutes to achieve is much less important than the entirety of the image which you may have ignored. Please try out some paper and pencils and use ctrl-z sparingly!</p>
