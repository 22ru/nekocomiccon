	<h2>acquisition syndrome: art style</h2>

    <p></p>
    <h3>Analog</h3>
    <h4>Inks</h4>
    <p>I have 3 scented fountain pen inks from Herbin. They're fun to paint with, but violet is light sensitive. I haven't noticed issues with cocoa and rose YET.</p>
    <p>Deleter Black 4 is allegedly water and copic proof. I disagree. Be careful not to wipe at this while wet because it will smear!</p>
    <p>I frequenly use Sakura Gelly Roll in white in all 3 sizes. Another favorite is Stardust clear for a touch of glitter. The glitter does come off a bit when you touch it.</p>
    <p>I own a white POSCA marker but it explodes every time I use it.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy copics for their super brush nibs. Other brands may also have brush tips, but I haven't found one that beats copic. </p>

    <h4>Paints</h4>
    <p>I'm using the Holbein Irodori gouache summer set. I like the color choices and would consider buying the other season sets.</p>

    <p>Do not ever buy the Artsmith gouache set. They stained my doll and my palette. Trash.</p>

    <!---------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3>Digital</h3>

    <p>My art program of choice is Krita due to limited Linux options. It's much easier to use than GIMP. I still use GIMP as well because there are places where Krita is lacking.</p>

    <p>I have allocated half the space on my desk for my Wacom Cintiq 16. The cable is 72 inches long and this is NOT in the specs. I would have appreciated if it was a bit longer. I use the xsetwacom drivers with default settings. If you're confused about Bezier curve values and want to adjust them, check out this <a href="https://linuxwacom.github.io/bezier.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site</a>.</p>

    <p>I sometimes have an issue where the cursor freezes. This is annoying but easily fixed by turning the pen around to the eraser and then back. I don't know where the issue lies between Krita, drivers, or the tablet.</p>

    <p>I highly recommend a remote for your tablet. I'm using a right joycon with some slight drift, which makes it annoying to use with my switch. I connect to it using blueman and use qjoypad to map the buttons.</p>

    <p>If your joycon is connected to your switch and you're having trouble connecting to it, use:</p>
    <p>bluetoothctl<br />
    connect [joycon MAC address]<br />
    quit<br /></p>

    <p>This set up is not nearly as simple and easy as on Windows. It can be a struggle. It's a labor of love for Linux.</p>

    <p>I do use an art glove with my tablet. At first I was just larping but my hand started sticking on the surface when I lost it and I now appreciate it a lot. </p>
