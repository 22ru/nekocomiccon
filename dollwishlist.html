<h2>wishlist</h2>

<p>This page got bigger than i expected so now it gets its own page. Surely this is not interesting information!</p>

<p>im going to do my best to spoil the dolls i have rather than buy more. what i really need is new wigs and shoes and not new dolls! please remind me when i get lost. i will get lost. i am only a human in a consumerist culture. slap me</p>

<p>im constantly rearranging to move dolls out of my wishlist and into my not wishlist. now reorganized into tiers! imagine a pyramid if you will or even a pyramid scheme!</p>

<h3>Tier 1: unobtainable</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Ten no Seihai:</b> Volks SDGr Mana-sama #00</li>
		<p>Mana-sama's personal Mana-sama dollfie. No other SDGr Mana-sama will suffice. Can be seen in all the recent Mana-sama cooking videos.</p>

		<li>Volks Mother SD</li>
		<p>dream big</p>

		<li>Dream FCS order</li>
		<p>I'm getting a PS Bisque Lieselotte on the yumetenshi SDgr body (small bust, one piece torso). I haven't picked my faceup artist yet.</p>
	</ol>

<h3>Tier 2: unlikely</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Volks in person FCS order at Tenshi no Sato</li>
		<p>Currently not an option but this doesn't mean it won't be someday. I have lots of time to dream about what I want my doll to look like and I'm going to enjoy every second of it. The cost of this one will be quite high since it requires going to Japan. Honestly might as well buy an Ever Beauty at that point. I am not willing to settle for an online FCS (I'm gonna end up eating my words on this one). Thinking of F98 or F73 on a B-09 or B-10 body with H-12 hands and FO-02 high heel feet.</p>

		<li>Volks One-Off Model</li>
		<p>I think it'd be great to win a lottery for one of these! I'd like to win a Kurumi/Miruku, Victorique, Kazuya, or Suiseiseki/Souseiseki. I really think it's important to be in love with the faceup of the doll you enter for since it's sacrilege to wipe it (unless damaged). There are many I wouldn't enter for even if I like the sculpt because I don't care for the faceup. I'll let someone else win those ones!</p>

		<li>Volks Rei-Tenshi or Sei-Tenshi</li>
		<p>I would never buy one but it is my dream to win one! What an honor it is to bring one of these home from dolpa. I believe being given one is part of the experience of owning one.</p>
	</ol>


<h3>Tier 3: reasonable expectations</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Obitsu 22 or 24 bodies in natural/flesh </li>
		<p>Upgrade bodies for my Licca-chans. maybe one of each? </p>

		<li>Volks Clannad School Uniform</li>

		<li>Volks DearSD</li>
		<p>I am in love with this body size (unproven). I don't think I want to buy one secondhand, so I will wait until Mother SD says it's my turn.</p>

		<li>Volks SD Hands</li>
		<p>I can't decide which ones I want!! I want H-12 the most but it's the only option I can't have. Thinking of H-04, H-17, H-09, H-07.</p>

		<li>Volks DD Yui Hirasawa</li>
		<p>Need a big yui for my yui collection. Her face is not my favorite and could definitely be more accurate to the anime art. She'll need a new faceup and wig but the fullset is non-negotiable.</p>
	</ol>

<h3>Tier 4: stuck in my head</h3>
	<p>I'm hesitant to say I need these... I do like them though!</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Kinokojuice Kiki Munyukuchi</li>
		<p>God bless Kinoko Juice for releasing their dolls to the world. Kikipop is great, but now I want the real deal!</p>

		<li>Unoa Rowan Prim</li>
		<p>let's face it: we all know gentaro araki is my favorite sculptor of all time. i really should consider getting another doll made by him.</p>

		<li>Volks SD13 Boy Body (Pureskin Normal)</li>
		<p>for my Migidoll Miho head that has been sitting in a box since 2009. sorry, dude... next time i go to japan (yeah right) ill bring his headcap and look for a match. its on the backburner.</p>
	</ol>

<h3>Tier 5: dolls i especially enjoy seeing</h3>
	<p>I don't THINK I need to own any of these</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Angell Studio Biyao</li>
		<p>that is a CUTE smile</p>

		<li>Bluefairy Somang</li>
		<p>of course i like the closed mouth version of my favorite doll</p>

		<li>Bluefairy Miley</li>
		<p>i would ONLY buy one on the original single jointed bluefairy body. the new joints are absolutely unacceptable and i want nothing to do with them. her face is just not quite sarang and so i'm hesitant on her.</p>

		<li>Chicabi Bebe Bora and Peko</li>
		<p>what sweet faces! I wish they made them in DSD/SD size!</p>

		<li>Chicabi Enfant Kitty and Kanaria</li>

		<li>CP Delf Soony</li>
		<p>I used to regret not getting her before she was discontinued. It's alright! If I ever did end up with another CP doll, I'd hope it'd be her.</p>

		<li>Feeple 65 Chloe</li>
		<p>the first Chloe and the best Chloe. i saw one at Uncanny Dreams (2011) and she was just stunning!</p>

		<li>every Kinokojuice girl</li>
		<p>the order of my favorites is kiki, shizuku, jill, luna, nia/haine. please show me all of them though! they are wonderful</p>


		<li>Soom Humpty-Dumpty</li>
		<p>omfg its an EGG</p>

		<li>Volks DDP Iori Minase</li>
		<p>my fav imas! I'm not so sure about the DDP body right now. someone pointed out the weird calf sculpting and I just can't unsee it.</p>

		<li>Volks DDS Rin Kagamine</li>
		<p>i'm not a big fan of rin or anything but she has my favorite DD face sculpt. i wish i had any kind of an income when she was selling for less than retail! im not particularly interested in paying her current price though</p>

		<li>Volks DDS Yukiho</li>
		<p>my least favorite imas but god they did a good job on her. shes maybe my 2nd favorite DD sculpt. shes not on my wishlist because shes semiwhite and "i dont want to buy more hands"</p>

		<li>Volks DDB 9S</li>
		<p>i dont need him i dont need him i dont need him</p>
		<p>I HAVE A CRUSH ON 9S</p>
		<p>im going to make bad choices if i see him for cheap. i still dont need him though. i need him.</p>

		<li>Volks DDS Chihaya</li>

		<li>Volks MDD Arle</li>

		<li>Volks MSD-F-12 (Misha/Cynthia)</li>
		<p>I can't explain why I love her sorry. I just do. I'm going to pretend I'm the first to translate her name as Cynthia.</p>

		<li>Volks U-noss</li>
		<p>used to be a buy on sight doll when I didn't have money to buy on sight. She's a lot more common now it feels like. beautiful body lines and id love to see someone paint her face well without removing her eyelashes. i dont think i need her but she's a cool piece of Volks and gentaro araki history</p>


		<li>Volks SD Suiseiseki/Souseiseki</li>

		<li>Volks SD Charlotte</li>
		<p>Lieselotte and charlotte belong together. if you have both, that is great. PLEASE send photos</p>

		<li>Volks SD Mai</li>

		<li>Volks SD10 Victorique de Blois</li>
		<p>uh you cant have kazuya without victorique thats just h*cked up</p>
		<li>Volks SD13 Kazuya Kujo</li>
		<p>wtf why is he so cute</p>

		<li>Volks SDGr Belldandy</li>

		<li>Volks SDGr Lorina / Lorina 2</li>

		<li>Volks PS Bisque Kasumi and Yayoi</li>
		<p>I hope I will be blessed with the chance to look at one in the real life!</p>

		<li>Volks Super Dollfie Dream</li>
		<p>if you managed to grab one of these for christs sake PLEASE start posting pictures of it NOW</p>

		<li>Zaoll Luv</li>
		<p>she's just classic okay?</p>
	</ol>

<h3>Tier X: dolls i once loved very much</h3>
	<p>they are better left in my memories than in my house</p>

	<ol>
		<li>DOD DOC Petsha</li>
		<p>Petsha was my first doll love! I never pulled the trigger on her because I always would rather have SD sized dolls. Lately, I've looked back on her and I realized I never loved her face. I only loved her fullset. One of the girls in my comm even had her and her fullset and even seeing her IRL, I never felt like I needed to buy her right that instant. I looked recently at her and realized I don't even like her face. I'm glad I never got her, I don't think I would have been happy with her.</p>

		<li>SQ Lab Navi</li>
		<p>she is quite pretty, but the more I look at her she looks like a bootleg volks doll. is that a bad thing? at least the DG61 body looks so much nicer than the SD16</p>

		<li>Luts KDF Bory</li>
		<p>this little grumpy dude was almost my first doll until i saw Luts' site wasn't secure.</p>

		<li>Angell-Studio Cinderella (original)</li>
		<p>actually she is pretty cute after all.</p>

		<li>DIM Achernar</li>
		<p>this dude probably wouldn't have been a bad choice</p>

		<li>Volks DDS Mariko</li>
		<p>i got my hopes up too much once and now i dont even like looking at her. obviously it wasnt true love</p>
	</ol>

<h3>"haha this would be fun to find in a thrift shop"</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Sekiguchi Printemps</li>
		<p>those eyes are just insane</p>

		<li>Dianna Effner Emily</li>
		<p>god shes cute</p>
	</ol>
