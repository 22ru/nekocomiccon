<h2>wishlist</h2>

<p>This page got bigger than i expected so now it gets its own page. Surely this is not interesting information!</p>

<ol>
	<li>Volks DearSD</li>
	<p>This body size is so cute!! I would prefer a pureskin white one so I can swap heads with lieselotte. just a body would be fine, but a coco would be very nice! i have to be careful not to be impulsive about this one since i dont feel picky about the head at the moment</p>

	<li>Kinokojuice Kiki Munyukuchi</li>
	<p>God bless Kinokojuice for releasing her dolls to the world. Kikipop is great, but now I want the real deal! (eventually)</p>

	<li>Volks DD Yui Hirasawa</li>
	<p>Need a big yui for my yui collection. Her face could definitely be more accurate to the anime art. She'll need a new faceup and the fullset is non-negotiable.</p>

	<li>Volks DDS Rin Kagamine</li>
	<p>i'm not a big fan of rin or anything but she has my favorite DD face sculpt. i wish i had any kind of an income when she was selling for less than retail!</p>

	<li>Volks DDP Iori Minase</li>
	<p>my fav imas! I also regret that i had no income during her preorder! its okay though she's not super expensive right now. I don't know if i need her fullset, but i would like it. I'm not a fan of volks wigs. volks could put out a hibiki whenever they want just sayin...</p>

	<li><b>Ten no Seihai:</b> Volks SDGr Mana-sama #00</li>
	<p>Mana-sama's personal Mana-sama dollfie. No other SDGr Mana-sama will suffice.</p>

	<li>Sekiguchi Printemps</li>
	<p>Not a BJD. Waiting very excitedly to find one of these at a yard sale or thrift store.</p>

	<li>Dianna Effner Emily</li>
	<p>also not a BJD. i'm not sure about shelling out for a porcelain doll yet, but she would be a great thrift store find!</p>
</ol>

<h3>not quite wishlist yet</h3>

<p>I'm hesitant to say I need these...</p>

<ol>
	<li>Volks DDB 9S</li>
	<p>i dont need him i dont need him i dont need him</p>

	<p>I HAVE A CRUSH ON 9S</p>

	<p>im going to make bad choices if i see him for cheap. i still dont need him though. i need him.</p>

	<li>Bluefairy Miley</li>
	<p>appears to be the 60cm version of sarang. she doesnt look exactly like sarang though. I'd love to own sarang in all 3 sizes, but this body is just too modern. and by modern i mean the jointing is ugly</p>

	<li>Unoa Rowan Prim</li>
	<p>another "i want my doll sized up". the body is similar to unoss, and i really like that! do i really need multiples of all my dolls though? pretty low priority because of that.</p>

	<li>Volks SDM Coordinate Model</li>
	<p>if i ever find myself in a volks store in japan I will probably just buy one if i fall in love with one. it's hard to make a list of FCS faces i love because theres so g*d d*mn many cute ones. I'll let myself be impulsive one more time if i make it over there.</p>
</ol>

<h3>doll i especially enjoy seeing</h3>

<p>i dont think i need to own these but please send me pictures if you have one! honestly just send me pictures if you have a doll at all.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Volks SDGr Lorina</li>

	<li>Volks MDD Arle</li>

	<li>Volks U-noss</li>
	<p>used to be a buy on sight doll when I didn't have money to buy on sight. beautiful body lines and id love to see someone paint her face well without modding. i dont think i need her anymore since rowan was released</p>

	<li>Volks SD Suiseiseki/Souseiseki</li>
	<li>Volks SDGr Belldandy</li>
	<li>Volks SD Mai</li>
	<li>Volks SD13 Kazuya Kujo</li>
	<li>Volks SD Charlotte</li>
	<p>Lieselotte and charlotte belong together but i dont have the funds to buy both. I'm tempted to buy Charlotte someday still. if you have both, that is great. PLEASE send photos</p>

	<li>Feeple 65 Chloe</li>
	<p>the first Chloe and the best Chloe.</p>

	<li>Super Dollfie Dream</li>
	<p>if you managed to grab one of these for christs sake PLEASE start posting pictures of it</p>

	<li>Bluefairy Somang</li>
	<p>of course i like the closed mouth version of my favorite doll</p>

	<li>Volks DDS Yukiho</li>
	<p>my least favorite imas but god they did a good job on her. shes not on my wishlist because shes semiwhite and "i dont want to buy more hands"</p>

	<li>Volks DDS Chihaya</li>
