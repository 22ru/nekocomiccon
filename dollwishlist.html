<h2>wishlist</h2>

<p>This page got bigger than i expected so now it gets its own page. Surely this is not interesting information!</p>

<p>im going to do my best to spoil the dolls i have rather than buy more. what i really need is new wigs and shoes and not new dolls! please remind me when i get lost. i will get lost. i am only a human in a consumerist culture. slap me</p>

<p>im constantly rearranging to move dolls out of my wishlist and into my not wishlist. now reorganized into tiers! imagine a pyramid if you will or even a pyramid scheme!</p>

<h3>Tier 1: unobtainable</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Ten no Seihai:</b> Volks SDGr Mana-sama #00</li>
		<p>Mana-sama's personal Mana-sama dollfie. No other SDGr Mana-sama will suffice. Can be seen in all the recent Mana-sama cooking videos.</p>

		<li>Volks Mother SD</li>
		<p>dream big</p>
	</ol>

<h3>Tier 2: unlikely</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Volks Rei-Tenshi or Sei-Tenshi</li>
		<p>I would never buy one but it is my dream to win one! What an honor it is to bring one of these home from a Dollpa. I believe being given one is part of the experience of owning one.</p>

		<li>Volks in person FCS order at Tenshi no Sato</li>
		<p>Currently not an option but this doesn't mean it won't be someday. I have lots of time to dream about what I want my doll to look like and I'm going to enjoy every second of it. The cost of this one will be quite high since it requires going to Japan. Honestly might as well buy an Ever Beauty at that point. I am not willing to settle for an online FCS (currently).</p>
	</ol>


<h3>Tier 3: reasonable expectations</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Volks DD Yui Hirasawa</li>
		<p>Need a big yui for my yui collection. Her face is not my favorite and could definitely be more accurate to the anime art. She'll need a new faceup and wig but the fullset is non-negotiable.</p>

		<li>Volks SD13 Boy Body (Pureskin Normal)</li>
		<p>for my Migidoll Miho head that has been sitting in a box since 2009. sorry, dude... next time i go to japan (yeah right) ill bring his headcap and look for a match.</p>

		<li>Obitsu 22 or 24 bodies in natural/flesh </li>
		<p>Upgrade bodies for my Licca-chans. maybe one of each? </p>
	</ol>

<h3>Tier 4: stuck in my head</h3>
<p>I'm hesitant to say I need these... I do like them though!</p>

<ol>
	<li>Volks DDP Iori Minase</li>
	<p>my fav imas! I also regret that i had no income during her preorder! its okay though she's not super expensive right now. I don't know if i need her fullset, but i would like it. I'm not a fan of volks wigs. volks could put out a hibiki whenever they want just sayin...</p>

	<li>Volks DDS Rin Kagamine</li>
	<p>i'm not a big fan of rin or anything but she has my favorite DD face sculpt. i wish i had any kind of an income when she was selling for less than retail! im not particularly interested in paying her current price though</p>

	<li>Volks DearSD</li>
	<p>I am in love with this body size (unproven). I would prefer a pureskin white one so I can swap heads with lieselotte. just a body would be fine, but a WS Coco would be very nice (WS Coco does not exist)! i have to be careful not to be impulsive about this one since i dont feel picky about the head at the moment. I entered the September 2021 VolksUSA lottery for a DSD Mai and did not win QQ</p>

	<li>Kinokojuice Kiki Munyukuchi</li>
	<p>God bless Kinokojuice for releasing their dolls to the world. Kikipop is great, but now I want the real deal!</p>
</ol>

<h3>Tier 5: dolls i especially enjoy seeing</h3>
<p>I don't think I need to own any of these</p>

<ol>
	<li>Volks MDD Arle</li>

	<li>Volks U-noss</li>
	<p>used to be a buy on sight doll when I didn't have money to buy on sight. She's a lot more common now it feels like. beautiful body lines and id love to see someone paint her face well without removing her eyelashes. i dont think i need her but she's a cool piece of Volks and gentaro araki history</p>

	<li>Volks SDGr Lorina / Lorina 2</li>
	<li>Volks SD Suiseiseki/Souseiseki</li>
	<li>Volks SDGr Belldandy</li>
	<li>Volks SD Mai</li>

	<li>SDM-F-12 (Misha/Cynthia)</li>
	<p>I can't explain why I love her sorry. I just do. I'm going to pretend I'm the first to translate her name as Cynthia.</p>

	<li>Volks SD13 Kazuya Kujo</li>
	<p>wtf why is he so cute</p>

	<li>Volks SD Charlotte</li>
	<p>Lieselotte and charlotte belong together. if you have both, that is great. PLEASE send photos</p>

	<li>Feeple 65 Chloe</li>
	<p>the first Chloe and the best Chloe. i saw one at Uncanny Dreams (2011) and she was just stunning!</p>

	<li>Super Dollfie Dream</li>
	<p>if you managed to grab one of these for christs sake PLEASE start posting pictures of it NOW</p>

	<li>Bluefairy Somang</li>
	<p>of course i like the closed mouth version of my favorite doll</p>

	<li>Volks DDS Yukiho</li>
	<p>my least favorite imas but god they did a good job on her. shes maybe my 2nd favorite DD sculpt. shes not on my wishlist because shes semiwhite and "i dont want to buy more hands"</p>

	<li>Volks DDS Chihaya</li>

	<li>Delf Soony</li>
	<p>I used to regret not getting her before she was discontinued. It's alright! If I ever did end up with another CP doll, I'd hope it'd be her.</p>

	<li>Bluefairy Miley</li>
	<p>appears to be the 60cm version of sarang. she doesnt look exactly like sarang though. I'd love to own sarang in all 3 sizes, but this body is just too modern. and by modern i mean the jointing is ugly. NEW UPDATE: i just found out there is a classic style sd sized body so if a miley with the old body showed up i might look very hard at it.</p>

	<li>Unoa Rowan Prim</li>
	<p>another "i want my doll sized up". the body is similar to unoss, and i really like that! do i really need multiples of all my dolls though? pretty low priority because of that.</p>

	<li>Volks DDB 9S</li>
	<p>i dont need him i dont need him i dont need him</p>
	<p>I HAVE A CRUSH ON 9S</p>
	<p>im going to make bad choices if i see him for cheap. i still dont need him though. i need him.</p>

	<li>every Kinokojuice girl</li>
	<p>the order of my favorites is kiki, shizuku, jill, luna, nia/haine. please show me all of them though! they are wonderful</p>

	<li>Volks PS Bisque Kasumi and Yayoi</li>
	<p>I hope I will be blessed with the chance to look at one in the real life!</p>

	<li>Chicabi Enfant Kitty</li>

	<li>Angell Studio Biyao</li>
	<p>that is a CUTE smile</p>

	<li>Soom Humpty-Dumpty</li>
	<p>omfg its an EGG</p>
</ol>

<h3>Tier X: dolls i once loved very much</h3>

<ol>
	<li>DOD DOC Petsha</li>
	<p>Petsha was my first doll love! I never pulled the trigger on her because I always would rather have SD sized dolls. Lately, I've looked back on her and I realized I never loved her face. I only loved her fullset. One of the girls in my comm even had her and her fullset and even seeing her IRL, I never felt like I needed to buy her right that instant. I looked recently at her and realized I don't even like her face. I'm glad I never got her, I don't think I would have been happy with her.</p>

	<li>SQ Lab Navi</li>
	<p>she is quite pretty, but the more I look at her she looks like a bootleg volks doll. is that a bad thing? at least the DG61 body looks so much nicer than the SD16</p>

	<li>Luts KDF Bory</li>
	<p>this little grumpy dude was almost my first doll until i saw Luts' site wasn't secure.</p>

	<li>Angell-Studio Cinderella (original)</li>
	<p>actually she is pretty cute after all.</p>

	<li>DIM Achernar</li>
	<p>this dude probably wouldn't have been a bad choice</p>

	<li>Volks DDS Mariko</li>
	<p>i got my hopes up too much once and now i dont even like looking at her. obviously it wasnt true love</p>
</ol>

<h3>"haha this would be fun to find in a thrift shop"</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Sekiguchi Printemps</li>
		<p>those eyes are just insane</p>

		<li>Dianna Effner Emily</li>
		<p>god shes cute</p>
	</ol>
