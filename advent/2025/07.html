	<h2>No Draw November sketchbook scans</h2>
	<h4 class="date">December 7, 2025</h4>

	<p>Here you are! One <a href="https://22ru.github.io/archive/art/sketchbook/202511.pdf" target="_blank">sketchbook scan</a>, coming up!</p>

	<p><a href="https://oldoldcool.cool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linus</a> and I (mostly Linus) looked into scanners during the great scramble for artist trading card prints of October 2025. He found out most people are "scanning" with their camera.</p>

	<p>I hate doing this because of uneven lighting. Today the sun twinkled in very cutely through the trees, but it made a shadow pattern on my images. I'm constantly having to readjust the page to get it straight on in the frame. This was truly a terrible experience before I started using my tripod.</p>

	<p>I'm manually cropping the images. I'd like to use imagemagick to automate it, but the page isn't consistent within the frame ;_; ANYWAY, scanners are still useful in 2025!</p>
