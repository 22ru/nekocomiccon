	<p>Really cool little filter. If you have the light in focus, you get the effect above. If you have the light source unfocused, they turn out like <a href="../../img/plushadvent25/CIA08878.jpg">this</a>. I don't have enough practice with it to utilize it well!</p>

	<p>We are finishing off with "Christmas Chicken".</p>

	<p>The advent calendar came with a fold out pamphlet explaining each of the characters. There were a lot of surprises! I did not expect a few of them to be the animal the pamphlet claims them to be. My favorites were day 21 "Gingerbread Buddy" and day 7 "Puppy Barkley", who is not a bear. Now the big question is: what the h*ck do I do with them all?</p>

	<p>I managed to get 18 days completed this year. I can't promise I'll participate next year. All boxes are clickable, but the "blank" ones only reveal the plushie for the day. Thank you for sticking with me and I hope everyone has a pleasant Christmas and a happy new year!</p>
