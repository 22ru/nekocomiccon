	<p>I love him so much~ I didn't have him with me for his 15th birthday, but he'll be with me for his 16th later this month!! Smoochies!!! Chu chu~~</p>

	<p>Just in! I was gifted a "Mini Plush Advent Calendar" as an early birthday present! I asked not to get the Pokemon advent calendar this year after last year's Chien Pao disaster. I hate Chien Pao so much.</p>

	<p>It looks like it's not a bootleg of Squishmallow, but definitely hopping on the trend of squishy plushes.</p>
