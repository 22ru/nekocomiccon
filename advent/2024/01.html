<h2>No Draw Novemeber failure report</h2>
<h4 class="date">December 1, 2024</h4>

<p>I had so much trouble getting these bad boys in a file. I used 2 sketchbooks over these months. The first was a 11x14" and the second was a 9x12". The first does not even pretend to fit in the scanner. There's no helping it. The smaller one almost maybe fits in the scanner. I tried a bunch of pages from it and found it stopping in the middle of a page and asking for the next page.</p>

<p>Look mom, I'm an real art!!!!!</p>

<p>I ended up taking all of them on my camera, cropping in GIMP manually, editing contrast and resizing with mogrify, then creating a PDF using img2pdf. I'm not great at image editing on command line, so they're a little fried. I'm not even sure if the contrast edits are an improvement.</p>

<p>Regardless, please enjoy 33.9 MB of my <a href="../../img/art/sketchbook/nodraw2024.pdf" target="_blank" >No Draw November failure</a>.</p>

<p>Ryan bought me the Pokemon TCG advent calendar again this year, so I'll also be sharing the finds from that. The inner box this year is all cardboard instead of a plastic holder. It makes it a little harder to get the items out.</p>

<p>Today's item is Chien Pao! He's not very cute.</p>
