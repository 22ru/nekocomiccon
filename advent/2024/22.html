<h2>Music wrap up</h2>
<h4 class="date">December 22, 2024</h4>

<p>I don't use Spotify (obviously) and quit scrobbling on last.fm many years ago, so here are my top 5 albums discovered this year.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A*Teens - ABBA Generation</li>
	<li>Mad at Gravity - Resonance</li>
	<li>Scritti Politti - Cupid & Psyche 85</li>
	<li>Erasure - The Innocents</li>
	<li>Boxcar - Vertigo</li>
</ul>

<p>As a bonus, I was finally able to access the YouTube Recap! I do use YouTube when if I don't have an album yet or am deciding if I should buy one. Thanks to YouTube, I didn't buy the latest Biebz album!</p>

<p>YouTube gave me one incredible recommendation this year: All Hail the Silence. It's Bluegrass Tom and Christian Burns (of BBMak) and this combo has a very low possibility of going wrong. I was in the top 2% of listeners? Perhaps of the 3 total listeners... YouTube hasn't been able to recommend me anything else worth listening to, so don't go there for new music.</p>

<p>Sometimes by Erasure came in first with.... 13 total listens! My sample size is so low, that Human League - Human (extended) is in there. I listened to it a few times after hearing it sampled in an LFO song. That song would be incredible if I didn't know English! Wasting My Time was also unexpected because I don't remember the tune off the top of my head or know who the artist is. Everything else is accurate. Yes, I am the life of the party and we are going to listen to Dir en Grey at the party.</p>

<p>Incredibly cute Snorunt today! I was already admiring the beauty of the common, so I'm VERY happy to get this one! I took a photo of the non-holo next to the holo, and the printing is a bit darker on the holo.</p>
