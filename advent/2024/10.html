<h2>/ppg/ - pen and pencil general</h2>
<h4 class="date">December 10, 2024</h4>

<p>I'm limiting this to pens and pencils I have used in the last 2 weeks. I own many more, but these ones are actually in use.</p>

<p>Erasers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sakura Arch foam eraser</li>
	<p>The arch shaped holder gimmick does help after all.</p>
	<li>Pentel Clic Eraser ZE23</li>
	<p>I have a lot of these, but this one is pink! It's good for erasing tight spots, but not too tight.</p>
	<li>Pacific Arc Soji eraser</li>
	<p>It's nice and soft and a cute yellow~</p>
</ul>

<p>Lead holders:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Koh-I-Noor Technigraph 5611</li>
	<p>2H lead. I use this constantly for my under sketching. I chose to put the lead I spend more time with in it rather than the plastic lead holder.</p>
	<li>Koh-I-Noor 5612</li>
	<p>2B lead. Used for darker lines. Staedtler puts a little metal piece around the ends of their refills, and it doesn't work in this holder. You have to snap it off.</p>
</ul>

<p>I really like my lead holders even though they are just expensive pencils. It seems to be a little hard to locate the refills for these if you're against purchasing "art alternatives". Staedtler made the graphite refills I'm currently using. I usually keep them extended a decent amount. The blue one is just short because I snapped the lead recently and kept using the broken off piece.</p>

<p>Mechanical pencils:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pentel GraphGear 500 0.3</li>
	<p>I just bought this so it's filled with whatever lead Pentel put in it. However, the darkest graphite I can find for this is B. I have yet to find there's an advantage over .5, but it is a sturdy feeling pencil.</p>
	<li>Rotring 600 0,5mm</li>
	<p>I can't recall which lead I filled this with, but it's harder than 4B. Maybe HB? Generally used when I'm trying to figure out details in the light sketch.</p>
	<li>Pentel P205 0.5mm</li>
	<p>4B graphite. I use it for fine details in the darker sketch.</p>
</ul>

<p>Pens:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Parker IM previously owned by Lindsay</li>
	<p>If I have to use a ballpoint for water resistance, I'm going to use a nice one. I'm sure this one was made in China though since it's from Q2 2013. It's got a knock off refill in it because I'm trying to use up the ones that have appeared in my life. I think this is my last one!</p>
	<li>LAMY Safari F</li>
	<p>Inked in J. Herbin Parfum Rose. I haven't inked any drawings lately. I use this one for writing.</p>
</ul>
