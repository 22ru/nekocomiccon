<h2>Cheby at the Tacoma mall</h2>
<h4 class="date">December 2, 2024</h4>

<p>I spent my day with my best friend! We went shopping~</p>

<p>Our bonus of the day is little Cooper (tentative) who we waited very long for. He finally has a wig and faceup! I'm so proud~ He's a little rockstar.</p>

<p>Cooper (tentative) has been blank for a very long time! After lots of bullying, he finally got a faceup and a wig.</p>

<p>He looks so silly in Hina's arms, like her new massive doll! Their stylization and size mismatch in the stangest way. It's very disturbing that he has the same size feet as Hina. Still not sure what to think of that.....</p>

<p>It was also the first time I met Miss Peyton! I've been asking to see her for a few years. She had been stuck with a bad faceup from her previous owner for many years and a bit of bullying caused her to get wiped and redone. I'm very happy to see her getting some love! She's becoming a cutie~</p>

<p>I've heard Pafa is very Bad at CoD Black Ops 6, but I have yet to see any evidence to support this claim.</p>

<p>I went to open my advent calendar, and the cardboard inner is definitely having issues. I had to call Ryan in to have him fix it for me so I wouldn't get a sneak peak at tomorrow! He said the item definitely does not fit in the space provided.</p>
