	This is my haiku<br/>
	It's about bunny rabbits<br/>
	I love them so much

<p>My photo today is of the Christmas lights in Pioneer Square, Seattle. If you are curious why the right half looks lit and the left half doesn't, please check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pulse width modulation</a>! Both sides were lit at equal brightness, but the duty cycles between the two sides are offset. My shutter speed (1/500) was fast enough to catch it, but eyes can't.</p>
