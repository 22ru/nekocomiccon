<h2>hat's spotify round up</h2>
<h4 class="date">December 9, 2023</h4>

<p>I don't have spotify and don't know how to check play count so here's my best guess at what I listened to this year!</p>

<ul>
	<li>Incubus - Crow Left of the Murder</li>
	<li>AFI - Decemberunderground</li>
	<li>Metric - Synthetica</li>
	<li>New Order - Republic</li>
	<p>It seemed kind of late in their discography, but it's really good.</p>
	<li>Nine Inch Nails - With Teeth</li>
	<li>Puddle of Mudd - Come Clean</li>
	<p>Ryan told me this album was weak the other day.</p>
	<li>Silversun Pickups - Carnavas</li>
	<p>I've had this on repeat for at least a month.</p>
	<li>Marilyn Manson - Eat Me, Drink Me</li>
	<p>I bought this one for Ryan at the beginning of the year, but I kinda wish I kept it.</p>
	<li>ABC - Absolutely</li>
	<p>A greatest hits album that I will need more of please.</p>
	<li>The Smiths - Best... I</li>
	<p>Another greatest hits. Still haven't seen an actual album.</p>
	<li>Da Buzz - Da Sound</li>
	<li>ATC - Planet Pop</li>
	<li>Level 42 - Running In The Family</li>
	<li>Pet Shop Boys - Very, Actually</li>
	<p>I bought both albums at the same time and they the same album in my mind.</p>
	<li>LFO - Life is Good</li>
	<li>BBMak- Sooner or Later</li>
	<li>Captain Jack - Captain's Best</li>
	<li>Bush - Sixteen Stone</li>
	<li>Hum - You'd Prefer an Astronaut</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour one out for all the albums I forgot</p>
