<h2>family portrait</h2>
<h4 class="date">December 4, 2023</h4>

<p>I slept in too long this morning and made myself a fuzzy head sleepy day. Whoops...</p>

<p>A couple days ago, I realized I haven't taken a family portrait since March! This is also the first one where I didn't have to take a second shot without Praline so I could post it on DoA. Between these, I replaced Liam's wig that I just couldn't get into and turned Grassy into my bunny son. Grassy became Cheby's 3rd tormenter, behind me and Rio.</p>

<p>Family portraits are always really <s>fun</s> to take! Between trying to get eye contact from 10 dolls, making sure paper-white Praline and tan Verona and Rio are still visible, brushing Rio's hair 10 times, making sure the furthest doll and frontmost doll are in focus, it's a lot of work. I really wanted to be more open than f/8, but I couldn't even open up a click more and keep both Hina and Praline in focus. I couldn't manage to get my ringlight out of the reflection so please enjoy Liam's extra romantic glance.</p>
