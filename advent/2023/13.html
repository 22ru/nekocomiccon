<h2>my tensai tree idea</h2>
<h4 class="date">December 13, 2023</h4>

<p>I've been given a few of these cute little anime girls! While they are very cute, I'm never quite sure what to do with them. My itabag is themed with "bad" so I can't keep them in there... I just keep them on my desk...</p>

<p>While playing with Hina the other day, I was struck with my most genius idea since tea jello.</p>

<p>It is beautiful and thank god my mom isn't at my house to see it.</p>
