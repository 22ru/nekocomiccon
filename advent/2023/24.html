<h2>Christmas is over.</h2>
<h4 class="date">December 24, 2023</h4>

<p>Can you believe I made it to 24 days of silly posts?? Thank you to everyone who did online advent calendars this year! I've enjoyed repeatedly refreshing each of your pages for updates. Are you sad you weren't thanked? Next year, it could be you too!!</p>

<p>I thought I did a lot more drawing this year and not very much time gaming, but it turns out I used that time to read manga instead. I did draw more at least...</p>

<p>I always loved drawing growing up, but I quit during college. Now that it's becoming clear that my college experience was merely a college experience, I want to improve a lot more in my original passion!! I'm still not sure how to draw a face... Surely I'll figure it out!</p>

<p>I'll end this with one of Ryan's most precious ornaments! He allegedly had a little cup, but I've never seen it to confirm.</p>
