<h2>ハットの記憶</h2>

<p>do you remember hat?</p>

<h3><a href="archive/blindcon2013/index.html" target="_blank" >Blindcon 2013</a></h3>
<p>This site was inspired by an image posted on 4chan the year before. The business card has been censored. They were printed on a home printer that was running out of ink owned by a friend in his dorm room. I handed them out at the con and once in a blue moon, someone will show me they still have it in their wallet.</p>

<p>I'm still searching for you, <a href="archive/blindcon2013/images/blindcon2012.jpg" target="_blank" >Captain Des Moines</a>.</p>

<p>A follow up to the 2013 site. This was the <a href="archive/blindcon2014/card.jpg" target="_blank" >card</a> (censored) I handed out that year at the convention. It didn't seem to make it into the site, but the file is there.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/hat1/index.html" target="_blank" >Personal Site</a></h3>
<p>Many images were removed that I don't have any rights to use. I left official images (which I also have no right to use). This <a href="https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1188800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patchy by yujup</a> was the header background.</p>

<p>The boards link was to my imageboard which has been dead and gone for many years. There's also a link to this site! It was very different back then.</p>

<p>This one focuses a lot more on cosplay than dolls.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/hat2/index.html" target="_blank" >Personal Site</a></h3>
<p>All images were removed that I don't have any rights to use. I have removed all links to my social media profiles. I think only one still exists anyway.</p>

<p>The cosplay section was just a link to cospix, art was a link to pixiv, but the doll section of this one is more filled out. Turns out I named some of my dolls and forgot their names! Must not have been good names.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/2013neocities/index.html" target="_blank">hat.neocities.org (2013-2021)</a> EPILEPSY WARNING!!!</h3>

<p>remember when neocities came out?! I always wanted a geocities but I was under the impression it cost money to have one when I was young. I jumped on making an account early! and wasted it on this junk!</p>

<p>I am kind enough to hotlink music from tumblr. Somehow they still haven't blocked me from using this link.</p>

<p>I had a really nice 404 page which was a flash of Skrillex playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7pOJjgu1X4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smile Taisou</a> which I removed. Or maybe that was on my imageboard?</p>

<p>I'll be nice and put a seizure warning here because I cannot look at this page without getting a headache. It's actually painful.</p>

<p>In 2013, I decided I wanted to make an imageboard! I found tinyboard, installed it on a free webhost, and made a few boards including /jb/ - Justin Bieber, /doll/ - BJD, /qt/ - cute boy. I managed to get a few friends to post on it with me, but it was really empty.</p>

<p>Also in 2013, the seagulls had complained enough that moot had come to the board to take suggestions for improvement to moderation. Janitors were put in place and any mention of drama involving lolcows was removed.</p>

<p>FunkBrothers suggested to me a few times that I should add a pixyteri board on my imageboard. I've always been one for shitposting, but not really one for whatever this is. I declined a few times, but eventually caved. I added /pt/ - PXEteri which he linked on /cgl/ shortly after.</p>

<p>It was quiet at first, but suddenly there were tons of people visiting that board! The free host I was using did not allow NSFW content and couldn't handle the traffic, so I had to switch to paid hosting, despite not having any form of income and angry anons not willing to donate. I moved only the drama boards to paid hosting since the boards made for me were doing just fine.</p>

<p>At some point, some users tried to doxx me. They got it wrong, but I gave up on them. There's no point in adding misery to your life for people you don't know and hate you. I didn't renew hosting and abandoned the board. My other boards stayed up for a while after, but were eventually removed by the free host for lack of traffic.</p>

<p>I did NOT get a good reaction from this one!!! Just imagine a whole room staring at me disapprovingly as I walk out of the room in my skimpy suw@ko cosplay.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/endofcgl/endofcgl.html" target="_blank" >J-fasion</a> - November 25, 2012</h3>

<p>moot visits cgl and permabans me for my great suggestion.</p>
