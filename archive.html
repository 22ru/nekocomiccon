<h2>ハットの記憶</h2>

<p>do you remember hat?</p>

<h3><a href="archive/blindcon2013/index.html" target="_blank" >Blindcon 2013</a></h3>
<p>The site was inspired by an image posted on 4chan the year before. I'm still searching for you, Captain Des Moines.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/blindcon2014/index.html" target="_blank" >Blindcon 2014</a></h3>
<p>A follow up to the 2013 site. This was the <a href="archive/blindcon2014/card.jpg" target="_blank" >card</a> I handed out that year at the convention. It didn't seem to make it into the site, but the file is there.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/hat1/index.html" target="_blank" >Personal Site</a></h3>
<p>Many images were removed that I don't have any rights to use. I left official images (which I also have no right to use). This <a href="https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1188800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patchy by yujup</a> was the header background. The boards link was to my imageboard which has been dead and gone for many years.</p>

<p>The site uses custom fonts which I'm sure will look better if you visit the github mirror instead.</p>

<p>This one focuses a lot more on cosplay than dolls.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/hat2/index.html" target="_blank" >Personal Site</a></h3>
<p>A few images were removed that I don't have any rights to use. I have removed all links to my social media profiles. I think only one still exists anyway.</p>

<p>The cosplay section was just a link to cospix, art was a link to pixiv, but the doll section of this one is more filled out. Turns out I named some of my dolls and forgot their names! </p>
