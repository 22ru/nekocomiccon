<h2>ハットの記憶</h2>

<p>do you remember hat?</p>

<h3><a href="archive/blindcon2013/index.html" target="_blank" >Blindcon 2013</a></h3>
<p>This site was inspired by an image posted on 4chan the year before. The business card has been censored. They were printed on a home printer that was running out of ink owned by a friend in his dorm room. I handed them out at the con and once in a blue moon, someone will show me they still have it in their wallet.</p>

<p>I'm still searching for you, <a href="archive/blindcon2013/images/blindcon2012.jpg" target="_blank" >Captain Des Moines</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/blindcon2014/index.html" target="_blank" >Blindcon 2014</a></h3>
<p>A follow up to the 2013 site. This was the <a href="archive/blindcon2014/card.jpg" target="_blank" >card</a> (censored) I handed out that year at the convention. It didn't seem to make it into the site, but the file is there.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/hat1/index.html" target="_blank" >Personal Site</a></h3>
<p>Many images were removed that I don't have any rights to use. I left official images (which I also have no right to use). This <a href="https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1188800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patchy by yujup</a> was the header background.</p>

<p>The boards link was to my imageboard which has been dead and gone for many years. There's also a link to this site! It was very different back then.</p>

<p>This one focuses a lot more on cosplay than dolls.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/hat2/index.html" target="_blank" >Personal Site</a></h3>
<p>All images were removed that I don't have any rights to use. I have removed all links to my social media profiles. I think only one still exists anyway.</p>

<p>The cosplay section was just a link to cospix, art was a link to pixiv, but the doll section of this one is more filled out. Turns out I named some of my dolls and forgot their names! Must not have been good names.</p>

<h3><a href="archive/2013neocities/index.html" target="_blank">hat.neocities.org (2013-2021)</a> EPILEPSY WARNING!!!</h3>

<p>remember when neocities came out?! I always wanted a geocities but I was under the impression it cost money to have one when I was young. I jumped on making an account early! and wasted it on this junk!</p>

<p>I am kind enough to hotlink music from tumblr. Somehow they still haven't blocked me from using this link.</p>

<p>I had a really nice 404 page which was a flash of Skrillex playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7pOJjgu1X4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smile Taisou</a> which I removed. Or maybe that was on my imageboard?</p>

<p>I'll be nice and put a seizure warning here because I cannot look at this page without getting a headache. It's actually painful.</p>
