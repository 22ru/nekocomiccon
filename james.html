<h2>to my love</h2>
<h3>in memory of James</h3>
<h4>200X to 200X</h4>

<img title="Feb 15, 2004" src="img/james.jpg" />

<p>Rest in peace my friend</p>

<p>Every time I look down at my ruined fingerprint, I remember you, my bitey companion. It still hurts when I press the scar wrong.</p>

<p>We had so many good times together and a few bad times too. You little stinker, you only escaped your cage 50 times before I had to put a lock on it.</p>

<p>I hope you are running in your little hamster wheel in hamster heaven all night long keeping all the other hamsters up.</p>
