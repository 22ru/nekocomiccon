<h2>to my love</h2>
<h3>in memory of James</h3>
<h4>200X to 200X</h4>

<img title="Feb 15, 2004" src="img/james.jpg" />

<p>rest in peace my friend</p>

<p>every time i look down at my ruined fingerprint, i remember you, my bitey companion. it still hurts when i press it wrong.</p>

<p>we had so many good times together and a few bad times too. you little stinker, you only escaped your cage 50 times before i had to put a lock on it.</p>

<p>i hope you are running in your little hamster wheel in hamster heaven all night long keeping all the other hamsters up</p>
