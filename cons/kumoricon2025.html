<h2>Kumoricon 2025</h2>
<h4 class="date">October 31 - November 2, Portland, OR</h4>

<p>Surprise surprise! This is the third con in a row where <a href="https://kohidate.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohi</a> asked me to join her! <a href="https://oldoldcool.cool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linus</a> offered to let me stay with him, so I was all set!</p>

<p>I was a little excited to go to the Kaya concert, but unfortunately, his appearance was canceled a few days before the con. Miura Ayme was announced as his replacement.</p>

<p>While I was working on my business card, another artist told me about artist trading cards, so on day -1, I painted 9 trading cards to give away at the con. My plan was to give away prints of them and only trade the original for other originals. Linus and I struggled extremely hard on Day 0 to get prints of the cards made, but we were unsuccessful. I had been working on my business card and we were able to get those to print!</p>

<p>This is the first time since 2011 that I did not pick up my badge on day 0. I entered the registration room on day 1 and it was nearly empty. Kumoricon has stopped printing names on badges and instead is registering a preprinted badge with a QR code to your name. This was very smooth and welcome after the Sakuracon 2025 catastrophe earlier this year.</p>

<p>Kumoricon is now pushing itself as a ribbon convention. There were a few official ribbons such as "day 0 attendee". Many attendees at the con are handing them out as well! I saw a staff member who had binder clipped rolls of ribbons hanging off his badge.</p>

<h3>The Venue</h3>

<p>The Oregon Convention Center has a really cool feature: two spires, one with a massive<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foucalt pendulum</a>! </p>

<p>There are plenty of water bottle filling stations around the convention center. I didn't look close enough to see if there were drinking fountains as well in these areas, but I highly recommend bringing a water bottle. The food options inside the convention center are very expensive. Think $12 for a (non alcoholic) lemonade.</p>

<p>For food options outside the con center, we ate twice at the Metropolitan Taven, located in the Eastlund Hotel. Their brussel sprouts were really good! There is a cafe and gift shop located in the Hyatt Regency. Kohi highly recommended their flatbread pizza.</p>

<h3>Shopping</h3>

<p>Kumoricon has their Dealer's hall, Artist Alley, food trucks, autograph lines, art show and charity auction, all in one hall. This room was </p>

<p>What's the first thing you should do at any con? Buy out the Atelier Pierrot booth! I desperately needed a long sleeve blouse, but I also found a JSK I loved. Something about these drawstring bustled skirts makes my heart doki doki. I grabbed a <s>headband</s> neck accessory that I wanted to wear on my head anyway. The neck accessory didn't make it into the bag on our way out of the booth, but we noticed and ran back, where they were keeping it safe for us.</p>

<p>The Fakestar booth was combined with the Atelier Pierrot booth. They had Kaya merch, that was mostly sold out by the time I got there! I even saw something for Schwarz Stein, but I didn't see what the item was. A little futher down the table were cheki from a few different bands. Linus and I did a little gambling.</p>

<p>The booth girl was willing to do a pull to try to get your favorite. I asked her to pull Boogie or Sena from the Jiluka stack. She pulled me a most beautiful Boogie!! The next day, we went back and I was feeling a little sad I didn't have a Sena. Linus said we'd get 3?! She pulled a very good Sena first. We then got a Ricko and a less good Sena. Well, now I'm sad I don't have a Zyean to complete the band! We called it quits though and ended our gambling streak at 4 cheki.</p>

<p>I had a lot of luck in the AA this year! Kumoricon uses a jury system to choose from their applicants. This created a great variety of booths. A lot of cons I've been to this year have had a number of booths that sold nearly the same items and that was not the case at Kumoricon. Thank you to the jury for excellent curation!</p>

<p>My favorite booth was <a href="https://www.dagneo.art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dagneo</a>. She's a Portland based artist who seems to be even more obsessed with foutain pens than I am! I found her while searching through the Twitter hashtag for Kumoricon and was shocked to see a zine of fountain pen ink paintings! I don't buy fan work, but she had some very cute little 13 Sentinels keychains that tempted me. How often do you get to see Best Girl Tomi?! Linus and I went back to say hi so many times I was embarrassed for showing up so much.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/beet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beet</a> was another of my favorite booths. She was very passionate about her series "Cross of Corinthia"! She had the cutest scrapbook at her table of her characters for people to flip through. Beet, if you're reading this, scan and print your little scrapbook! I want to buy it!</p>

<p><a href="https://whispwill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whispwill</a> had some gorgeous prints! Linus bought this lovely monochromatic <a href="https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/whispwill/fsh-original-print-white/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demon girl</a>. I absoltuely loved the composition of this <a href="https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/whispwill/archon-venti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">print</a>, but unfortunately it was a Genshin Impact character. I'll be keeping an eye on this artist!</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/HanaeKariko" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HanaeKariko</a> was selling t-shirts and prints with designs I loved. I think her hydrangea fox girl and winged bird girl designs are very lovely! And how could I not fall for the doggie boy with baguettes?!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kirstenandersenartist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonlight</a> had incredibly detailed ink drawings. She had originals for sale as well. It was a treat to see her work after struggling through a very dip pen filled Inktober.</p>

<p><a href="https://rap1993.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rap1993</a> was also attending and she let me take a photo of her doll she had on display at her booth.</p>

<p>Some sales trends I noticed were photocard sized art, tiny tiny charms, fake mini CD cases. I want to make all of these things now!</p>

<p>I had one complaint with the Kumoricon AA: the aisles were very crowded and it looked like the artists had an excess of space behind them. I wish the artists got just a tad less space to add more to the aisles.</p>

<p>There was a blocked off area of the sales hall for the art show and charity auction. I read photographs were not allowed, but didn't actually see any signs when I got in there. The auctions were silent and lots of the sheets ignored the minimum bids listed on the papers.</p>

<h3>Outreach booths</h3>
<p>I have a few friends and acquataintces who love Vtubers, so I always go check out the Offkai Expo booth! My good friend <a href="https://x.com/whritual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frisk</a> always pulls me off screen when I'm there.</p>

<p>The ChibiChibiCon booth was there and ready to give us buttons for listening to their spiel! I listened a few times and got a few can badges of their mascot!</p>

<p>We always stop by Sakuracon booths to ask about our boy Mizuki. The booth was not able to tell me who is the Mizuki artist, but confirmed to me the art for 2026 is made by the same artist as 2025 and there are more from this artist and they were all commissioned at the same time. Boy would I love to have a look in that folder...</p>

<p>I had made a post on Den of Angels asking about a doll meetup at Kumoricon and got a response from a doller working at the Resin Rose booth. Almost all doll meetups are now organized over Discord, so a person who rejects Discord (me), will be completely out of the loop. I was told it was Saturday at 3, after being moved from 2 due to the organizer going to a different panel, and no location was listed. I'm really disappointed with the meetup organization skills of the Discord dollers.</p>

<p>Everyone at the Resin Rose booth was lovely! I loved seeing the mix of classic and new dolls that were on display at their booth.</p>


<p>I carried Cheby around for 2 days and he was the only resin doll I saw outside of the Resin Rose booth and Rap1993's AA booth. I have no other doller activities to report.</p>

<h3>Parties</h3>

<p>Me, being incredibly popular and famous, am always invited to many parties at every con! I must be choosy though because there are just too many to attend.</p>

<p>On Friday night, I went to the [redacted] room party. I was just hanging out when someone from the couch said "Fran Hat?!" to me! It was my buddy <a href="https://x.com/Ginko_02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ginko</a>!! I haven't seen him since AX 2017! He told me all about his favorite Vtuber, Marimari.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/juliusqueezer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCP</a> kicked me out so my night there ended early at 12 AM.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I attended the Umamusume party! I don't know anything about horses so I'm not sure why they let me in. Everyone was wearing horse tails. I'm not a big fan of tails on humans...</p>

<p>I ended up leaving early and heading back to the con center. There was party drama after I left, but instead of drama, you will soon read about my time at the FF14 art party panel!</p>

<h3>Panels</h3>

<p>Linus wanted to sit down, so the first panel we attended was "Monster Buddies" in the Chibi Room. They wanted me to make something scary for Halloween so I did my best!</p>

<p>My monster releases pollen that will make you sneeze for 5 days straight. Very scary!</p>

<p>We wanted to sit down a little later and decided to go to the Iron Cosplay panel. This was a quick game show where 3 teams of 4 members of the audience have 5 minutes to make a cosplay to a prompt on the model out of the materials provided. The secret to winning this fast paced contest is have your model and explaining team member be your most charismatic members.</p>

<p>I usually do not attend panels focused on yaoi/BL, but I found one titled "A Brief History of CLAMP Yaoi" and had no age restrictions, so we decided to give it a try. The panelist wearing a Jojo cosplay seemed to discuss a lot about Jojo, but I did get an overview of CLAMP works! I haven't studied them much yet.</p>

<p>We attended <a href="https://x.com/maullarmaullar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maullar's</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3HP9kXHtlg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"not legal advice"</a> panel where I believe he advised us to sue <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/teezan.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teezan</a>??</p>

<p>After I left the Umamusume party, Linus and I decided to try the "Art Thou Joking?" panel. The two panelists had set up a tablet on stage to show them drawing an audience member volunteer in selfie mode. The audience kept screaming "pop quiz!" and running to the front, which seemed to be inside joke from previous panels. We didn't find it particularly enjoyable so we left the panel.</p>

<p>Just 2 doors away was a panel called "Warriors of Light, Queue for Art Party, Halloween Weekend!" where we peeked in and saw a huge room of people drawing. We went inside and peeked at the drawings. There were a lot of people drawing various cartoon characters, so we got in line for an unknown destination and another attendee explained the panel was to draw art of other people's FF14 characters. There was a number of catboys in the pool of characters available! Sign me up!!</p>

<p>Linus and I grabbed paper and pencils and got to work! For some reason, the only erasers supplied were on the back of a few pencils, which I think was a big oversight. Or maybe my oversight was not bringing my own drawing tools? There also wasn't enough chairs so we ended up kneeling at the table on the floor.</p>

<p>Other attendees were handing out stickers and photocards of their characters. I was in heaven!!!</p>

<p>I left the catboy I drew in the last panel, named "MINECRAFT", on the table. I hope someone took him home and is enjoying him!</p>

<p>This was my favorite panel of the con and I will be looking for one at Sakuracon!</p>

<h3>Cosplay</h3>
<p>I haven't been heavily invested in cosplay in a few years, but I noticed my friends all showed up as Miku at the same time?! It was incredible!</p>

<p>First up is Stan, cosplaying fujoshi Miku.</p>

<p>And Bear, cosplaying midwestern emo Miku.</p>

<p>Our group shot, from left to right, is Jeremy (Patrick Bateman Miku), Aria (Scream Miku), Stan (fujoshi Miku), Rokotori (Costco Miku), Tae (Mike Myers Miku), Jorts (Halloween Miku), Eike (lab Miku), Bear (midwestern emo Miku). A few more Mikus came and went during this Miku meetup! My favorite was Rec's Terrifier Miku. </p>

<p>I took another picture of Rec, which I was asked not to post ;_; It was my best shot of the con, too!</p>

<h3>Artist Trading Cards</h3>
<p>Here are the results of the artist trading card trade that everyone was waiting for! No one was prepared with cards, but I had 3 people trade me with drawings they made on site.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/j0rtz_art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jorts</a> and <a href="https://x.com/e1ke_art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eike</a> drew Alice for me and <a href="https://x.com/t3ntamancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tae</a> drew Tenma! Thank you all so much! I will keep these precious drawings safe forever! I hope to see more artists joining in on the fun next time!</p>

<p>I'm going to try to carry a few of these with me in the future, so if you see me and want to trade, I want to trade!</p>

<h4>The Haul</h4>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>This con was super fun! We didn't get to funmax as hard due to not having a hotel room, but we still did a lot of activities and saw many of our friends.</p>
