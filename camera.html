<h2>welcome to my gear thread</h2>

<img src="img/IMG_4013ss.jpg" title="essential photo gear" />

<p>I leave the exif data on most photos if you're curious about what I used.</p>

<h3>Current:</h3>
	<dl>
	<dt>Sony a7 II</dt>
		<dd>I like this camera. It's nice. The body is small and lightweight (relatively).</dd>
	<dt>Sony FE 50mm f/1.8</dt>
		<dd>This lens makes me sad because it has no manual controls. It will be useless someday.</dd>
	<dt>Canon FDn 50mm f/1.4</dt>
		<dd>I am definitely abusing f/1.4. I am not sorry yet. Probably from June 1980. There's some grease on the aperture blades that worries me.</dd>
	<dt>iPhone XS</dt>
		<dd>It's okay I guess. HEIC is the bane of my existence. Portrait mode can make some funny AI choices as well.</dd>
	</dl>
<h3>Past:</h3>
	<dl>
	<dt>Samsung Galaxy Note 3</dt>
		<dd>At some point the motor stopped focusing and dust moved inside the lens. These photos were very <a href="img/IMG_20180704_212803_DROs.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Google Nexus 5</dt>
		<dd>I have good memories of this phone!!</dd>
	<dt>Canon Powershot SD13000 IS</dt>
		<dd>I used this one until my phone produced better quality images. It was a black friday deal.</dd>
	<dt>Kodak Easyshare C613</dt>
		<dd>My uncle bought this one for me after my fuji died. It was pink.</dd>
	<dt>Fujifilm FinePix A400</dt>
		<dd>My first xD card gave out early and the lens stopped retracting. I loved the photos it took, but you couldn't tell if they were blurry from the tiny screen.</dd>
	<dt>Digital Blue</dt>
		<dd>My first camera. I sure hope I saved the software disc... The UI is miserable to get photos off this thing.</dd>
