<h2>welcome to my gear thread</h2>

<img src="img/IMG_4013ss.jpg" title="essential photo gear" />

<p>This is my secondary hobby! My favorite subjects are dolls, Ryan, flowers, and baby animals, and also grown animals. I'm always trying to find a way to make my camera fit safely in my purse so I go through thrift store camera bags like crazy trying to find the smallest padded bag I can fit my camera in.</p>

<p>I don't try to remove the exif data on most photos if you're curious about what I used. Sometimes one of my resizing programs dumps it though...</p>

<h3>Current:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Sony a7 II</li>
		<p>I like this camera a lot! It's nice and my favorite to use. The body is small and lightweight (relatively). It was my college graduation present from my mom! I chose it because it was the cheapest FF (at the time) and I didn't want to upgrade from APS-C to FF in the future. I am tempted to buy a small MFT to throw in my purse sometimes...</p>
	<li>Sony FE 50mm f/1.8</li>
		<p>This lens makes me sad because it has no manual controls. It will be useless someday. There's not a lot of times that I use autofocus, but if I need it, I'll bring this lens.</p>
	<li>Canon FDn 50mm f/1.4</li>
		<p>I am definitely abusing f/1.4. I am not sorry yet. Probably from June 1980. There's some grease on the aperture blades that worries me. I use this one all the time!</p>
	<li>iPhone XS</li>
		<p>It's okay I guess. HEIC is the bane of my existence. Portrait mode can make some funny AI choices. This is better for taking room photos than my 50mm lenses.</p>
	<li><a href="gameboycamera.html">Game Boy Camera</a></li>
	<li>Canon PowerShot G2</li>
		<p>I don't play with this one very much because the battery lasts around 2 minutes. I can still used it while connected to the wall though.</p>
	<li>instax mini 7+</li>
		<p>my bestie bought it for me ;u; thank you!</p>

<h3>Past:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Samsung Galaxy Note 3</li>
		<p>At some point the motor stopped focusing and dust moved inside the lens. These photos were very <a href="img/IMG_20180704_212803_DROs.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic</a>.</p>
	<li>Google Nexus 5</li>
		<p>I have good memories of this phone!!</p>
	<li>Canon Powershot SD13000 IS</li>
		<p>I used this one until my phone produced better quality images. It was a black friday deal.</p>
	<li>Kodak Easyshare C613</li>
		<p>My uncle bought this one for me after my fuji died. It was pink.</p>
	<li>Fujifilm FinePix A400</li>
		<p>My first xD card gave out early and the lens stopped retracting. I loved the photos it took, but you couldn't tell if they were blurry from the tiny screen.</p>
	<li>Digital Blue</li>
		<p>My first camera. I sure hope I saved the software disc... The UI is miserable to get photos off this thing.</p>
