<h2>welcome to my gear thread</h2>

<img src="https://22ru.github.io/tophatcafe/img/gallery/cheby/IMG_3682.jpg" title="essential photo gear" />

<p>This is my secondary hobby! My favorite subjects are dolls, Ryan, flowers, and baby animals, and also grown animals. I'm always trying to find a way to make my camera fit safely in my purse so I go through thrift store camera bags like crazy trying to find the smallest padded bag I can fit my camera in.</p>

<p>I don't try to remove the exif data on most photos if you're curious about what I used. Sometimes mogrify removes it without asking. You're not likely to learn much since I use vintage lenses 99% of the time.</p>

<p>Things I don't enjoy:</p>
<ol>
	<li>editing photos</li>
	<p>maybe I'll adjust curves and crop if I'm having a good day</p>
	<li>shooting RAW</li>
	<p>mostly because I'm not going to edit the photos but also I'm not filling up my hard drive. jpg is fine for my purposes</p>
</ol>

<h3>Current:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Sony a7 II</li>
		<p>I like this camera a lot! The body is small and lightweight (relatively). It was my college graduation present from my mom! I chose it because it was the cheapest FF (at the time) and I didn't want to upgrade from APS-C to FF in the future. </p>
	<li>iPhone XS</li>
		<p>It's okay I guess. HEIC is the bane of my existence. Portrait mode can make some funny AI choices. I don't post pictures taken with this much because they suck.</p>
	<li><a href="gameboycamera.html">Game Boy Camera</a></li>
	<li>Canon PowerShot G2</li>
		<p>I don't play with this one very much because the battery lasts around 2 minutes. I can still used it while connected to the wall though.</p>
	<li>instax mini 7+</li>
		<p>my bestie bought it for me ;u; thank you!</p>
	<li>instax mini 8</li>
		<p>Possibly the best version of the instax mini? Mine has seen better days, but it was $1.</p>
	<li>instax pal</li>
		<p>Review <a href="instaxpal.html">here</a> for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<h4>Lenses</h4>

<p>I am using the basic Fotodiox FD-NEX adapter and K/AR-NEX adapter. I prefer prime to zoom but who am I to say no to a deal?</p>

There's a ring to change to macro mode, but it only can be turned at a focal length of 75mm. To focus in macro mode, you turn the macro ring instead of the usual focus ring.</td></tr>

<h3>Past:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Samsung Galaxy Note 3</li>
		<p>At some point the motor stopped focusing and dust moved inside the lens. These photos were very <a href="../img/IMG_20180704_212803_DROs.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic</a>.</p>
	<li>Google Nexus 5</li>
		<p>I have good memories of this phone!!</p>
	<li>Canon Powershot SD13000 IS</li>
		<p>I used this one until my phone produced better quality images. It was a black friday deal.</p>
	<li>Kodak Easyshare C613</li>
		<p>My uncle bought this one for me after my fuji died. It was pink.</p>
	<li>Fujifilm FinePix A400</li>
		<p>My first xD card gave out early and the lens stopped retracting. I loved the photos it took, but you couldn't tell if they were blurry from the tiny screen.</p>
	<li>Digital Blue</li>
		<p>My first camera. I saved the software disc thankfully! The UI is miserable to get photos off this thing.</p>
