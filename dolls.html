<p class="comment">I think i was a little too obsessed with sacha baron-cohen at the time. if I get him a body he might get a new less embarrassing name.</p>

<p class="comment">I bought him because I liked migidoll ryu. He is my lesson in "don't settle". He's still a beautiful boy though and i want to get him a body since I dont really intend to sell him at the moment. I wouldn't be able to prove his legitimacy anyway at this point. He's so old that everyone would be nervous to buy him.</p>

<p class="comment">His first owner (afaik) was Fayth, who I bought him from on DoA. He may have been purchased through a group order with his faceup artist Meeve in 2007.</p>

<p class="comment">I didn't know this head was modded until I'd had the doll for 10 years. He was purchased from DoA user Circe-Nausicca. The body is possibly from a split in November 2009, but I wasn't able to confirm this info.</p>

<p class="comment">this doll has a character i'd rather not talk about. it's about what'd you expect from a teenage fujoshi</p>

<p class="comment">sochi is my next soul vessel. please do not buy her unless you want a doll haunted by me. she is named after the then future location of the olympics. I was a little obsessed with male figure skaters at the time i got her.</p>

<p class="comment">whenever i look at her, i think "i love her. i love her. she is the one for me". im obsessed.</p>

<p class="comment">she has no box opening photos because there was no box opening. my friend had her listed for sale and just brought me the pieces at a meetup and i put her together before paying for her.</p>

<p class="comment">she is spoiled. i have more wigs and clothes in her size than i do for any other dolls despite only having one doll in her size. she is my favorite.</p>

<p class="comment">I bought her from my local comm member (and good friend) reichiere. She had recieved a Sarang with blossom body in a trade in early 2010 and taken the body for her own Xiao. I cannot find her previous owner! Sochi's old name may have been Viola. She had purchased her Xiao secondhand from DoA user Pia in 2006, who was the first owner and lived in Australia! My little world traveller! The body of her Xiao was put on sale with the Sarang head, and I snatched her up! Her head is lighter than her body even though they're both around the same age. She is my 2nd oldest doll age wise.</p>

<p class="comment">The yosd sized version of TF Sarang. good investment!</p>

<p class="comment">this doll was sold as a girl, but the owner offered me a refund of $50 when she noticed it was a boy body so i totally took it. was my cheapest doll at ~$100</p>

<p class="comment">Her history is a bit complicated too! I bought a blank shinyfairy hana girl from DoA user Pomegranate, who was the first owner. Upon wrapping her up, she noticed the body was a boy body instead and asked me if I still wanted it. I can't blame her for noticing... I didn't even notice in the sales photo. I did a faceup for her that wasn't awesome or anything. </p>

<p class="comment">My friend reichiere also had a SF Hana. Her Hana was originally purchased by Squishtaru, who also did the faceup. In July 2010, GoroChaggi bought her. In November 2010, Rei traded for her. Rei wanted a more natural faceup, so offered to trade me heads, which I took with a lot of guilt!</p>

<p class="comment">at pnw bbq expo, bluefairy was a vendor. the man working at the booth confirmed to us that both of our Hanas were the first version, and that hana 1.0 looked the most like sarang.</p>

<h2>dolls that are no longer with me</h2>

<p>i'm not really into selling dolls but here are my exceptions</p>

<p>i admit i did try to sell almost all of my dolls at one point, but now i feel like i can just make more money if i want other dolls. i am thankful almost all of my previous dolls never found buyers. i've had so many memories with them that i would be sad to not have them now</p>

<p class="comment">I wanted a doll to play with, so i bought one. came to me with uneven yellowing. obviously DDE had left this one on display for a while and the front of it was a slightly different color than the back. i will never buy from DDE again.</p>

<p class="comment">i sanded his chest down, gave him a few different faceups and had a good bit of fun with him. He was even visual kei for a while!</p>

<p class="comment">the sculpt quality wasnt up to my standards though. the body was just awful compared to my other dolls. nothing about the face stuck out to me either. just a plain doll.</p>

<p class="comment">i dont regret buying him or selling him. i gave him a nice girly faceup before sending him off to a new home</p>

<p class="comment">i was off hanging out with Ryan when i got a text from my friend to hurry back to the convention center and there they presented me with... mirodoll mika!!!</p>

<p class="comment">excuse me while i look a gift horse in the mouth for an honest review: this doll is sh*t. it cant stand, all the joints are like ????? its just not a good doll at all. spend your money on something better</p>

<p class="comment">i gifted this doll to tae on the terms that it cannot be sold, only gifted. i unstrung her for the trip to AX and found out she had been put together with exactly ONE s hook (in her head). im not sure tae ever got her strung tbh... it'd be a difficult one to string even as a bjd veteran (can i say that yet?)</p>
