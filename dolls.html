	<p class="comment">Rio was the first doll I ever bought! He's named after Rio by Duran Duran. Ryan called him a goblin and honestly it fits him too well.</p>

	<p class="comment">His head is so tiny on his 70cm body and it looks so goofy. His face though is so cute and sweet it doesn't match the muscle monster body at all! If it were at all possible for me to get him a DOT body, I'd jump on it immediately! Unfortunately I'll never find a smaller tan body to match.</p>

	<p class="comment">I've tried to sell him a few times. Every time I hold him though I'm happy I didn't. I've had so many fun memories with this doll! He definitely deserves some new clothes and wigs after all these years.</p>

	<p class="comment">This doll deserves the life of a king for still smiling all these years after all the cr*p i put him through as a teen.</p>

	<p class="comment">Sophie was bought from DoA user lookame for way too low of a price.</p>

	<p class="comment">Between me and my mom, we own 10% of this model limited to 20 worldwide. their faceups are just slightly different with olivia looking a little spicier than the softer sophie.</p>

	<p class="comment">if youre curious, bambicrony girls tend to be smaller overall than other yo sized dolls. their foot bridge is so flat that they do not fit in most yo shoes despite having the same foot length. they're also much thinner.</p>

	<p class="comment">I was a little too obsessed with Sacha Baron-Cohen at the time of Br√ºno because I originally named him "Sasha". He's now taking on the name of a Russian mathematician with an extremely fun name. Or just Cheby for short.</p>

	<p class="comment">I chose him because I liked migidoll and there was one available on the marketplace. I truly love Migidoll Ryu the most, but I thought Miho would be just as good. He is my lesson in "don't settle" because I had to buy a Ryu anyway. It took me over 13 years to get this boy a body and I felt nothing for him until I did. I am an irresponsible doll owner and I will never buy a floating head again.</p>

	<p class="comment">His first owner (afaik) was Fayth. He may have been purchased through a group order with his faceup artist Meeve in 2007. His body was purchased from nikittin, which was from Tsukasa Konoe purchased from Mandarake in 2016.</p>

	<p class="comment">He was my cheapest large doll at a total of about $285 after shipping. so affordable, the deals i make with a doa marketplace!</p>

	<p class="comment">Cheby is an incel and very grumpy. But I still give him many kisses üòö I have hope for his full recovery.</p>

	<p class="comment">Verona is baby face 1/3 scale boy! So cute! He's named after the location of Romeo and Juliet. If I use the name "V", I'm talking about this boy. You'll often see him with Liam.</p>

	<p class="comment">I'm not very happy with his current look. I think he is my doll in most need of a faceup upgrade. He still has the feel of the early Korean BJD.</p>

	<p class="comment">His resin is slightly translucent and has really sold me on French resin despite the yellowing issues. I don't purposely seek out tan dolls anymore, but I also think he's too light to be considered truly tan! He just looks tan next to my WS dolls. The French resin mix gives him a slight glow my others dont have.</p>

	<p class="comment">Liam is my favorite boy doll. His handsome face just steals my heart every time I look at him! With the right angle, he makes the face every girl wants to be looked at with. He spends a lot of time with both Verona and Hina.</p>

	<p class="comment">I didn't know this head was modded until I'd had the doll for 10 years and started looking through old dA posts for his history. He was purchased from DoA user Circe-Nausicca. I once thought I knew this doll's full history, but I've emailed Migidoll to ask about his resin tone and I now believe I know nothing at all. I feel like conspiracy meme dude every time I look up any history on his head. I believe he is Type B WS. The body is most likely from a IH Louis split with Aernath in November 2009.</p>

	<p class="comment">Once at a Japanese garden meetup in Spokane, a man complimented him and said he was a pretty girl. I quietly said thank you and my friend was like "no he's a boy!! look!!!" and flashed the poor man. Dude, I'm so sorry you had to see that...</p>

	<p class="comment">whenever i look at her, i think "i love her. i love her. she is the one for me". im obsessed.</p>

	<p class="comment">she has no box opening photos because there was no box opening. my friend had her listed for sale and just brought me the pieces at a meetup and i put her together before paying for her.</p>

	<p class="comment">she is spoiled. i have more wigs and clothes in her size than i do for any other dolls despite only having one doll in her size. she is my favorite.</p>

	<p class="comment">I bought her from my local comm member (and good friend) reichiere. She had recieved a Sarang with blossom body in a trade in early 2010 and taken the body for her own Xiao. I cannot find her previous owner! Sochi's old name may have been Viola. She had purchased her Xiao secondhand from DoA user Pia in 2006, who was the first owner and lived in Australia! My little world traveller! The body of her Xiao was put on sale with the Sarang head, and I snatched her up! Her head is lighter than her body even though they're both around the same age. She is my 2nd oldest doll age wise.</p>

	<p class="comment">this doll was sold as a girl, but the owner offered me a refund of $50 when she noticed it was a boy body so i totally took it. was my cheapest doll at ~$100</p>

	<p class="comment">Her history is a bit complicated too! I bought a blank shinyfairy hana girl from DoA user Pomegranate, who was the first owner. Upon wrapping her up, she noticed the body was a boy body instead and asked me if I still wanted it. I can't blame her for noticing... I didn't even notice in the sales photo. I did a faceup for her that wasn't awesome or anything. </p>

	<p class="comment">My friend reichiere also had a SF Hana. Her Hana was originally purchased by Squishtaru, who also did the faceup. In July 2010, GoroChaggi bought her. In November 2010, Rei traded for her. Rei wanted a more natural faceup, so offered to trade me heads, which I took with a lot of guilt!</p>

	<p class="comment">at pnw bbq expo, bluefairy was a vendor. the man working at the booth confirmed to us that both of our Hanas were the first version, and that hana 1.0 looked the most like sarang ;D</p>

	<p class="comment">she is my oldest (and most beautifully sculpted) doll! i believe she was cast in 2005 since her box came with B-El and L-bi faceplates. my darling had to wait 8 years to be put be put together.</p>

	<p class="comment">it's too bad kits aren't produced by many companies anymore. she was incredibly fun to assemble!</p>

	<p class="comment">because I assembled and painted her myself, she is the doll I am most proud of. Her sculpting in both face and body is really beautiful. The engineering is really ahead of its time for this 2003 body.</p>

	<p class="comment">my friends once brought up the possibility of her being a recast which freaked me out for many years. i now realize how silly that is since she was significantly yellowed in 2013 and came on the first body that was never recasted (not to mention she has literally all the paperwork and box). it was really a different time. i also lied to myself saying she wasn't that yellow when i got her but in reality she is so yellow! i believe her yellowing has been stable since 2013 though.</p>

	<p class="comment">Apologies to Sochi, Hina is my favorite doll and my dream come true.</p>

	<p class="comment">I don't like to use the term "grail", but Lieselotte is as close as I'd get to one. I first saw her 2nd release in 2013 and fell in love. I entered her lottery despite not having any good way to come up with $1k at the time. I did not win her and I could not buy one for secondhand prices. I watched as she had more lotteries, but I knew there was no way for me to pay for her if I had one, so I did not enter.</p>

	<p class="comment">I kept Lieselotte in my heart for all those years. I had no expectations of ever getting one due to my bad lottery luck and extremely high aftermarket prices. In 2021, somehow the stars all aligned! Lieselotte was released as a preorder, not a lottery, and I had a job so that I could afford her. I also happened to get all of my stimulus checks right before her preorder opened. I had sworn that if any of those checks ever showed up, I would buy myself a doll! I didn't expect that doll to be the one I've been wishing for for years.</p>

	<p class="comment">I entered two lotteries while waiting for her. I won neither and I was a little sad Mother SD wouldn't bless me with a doll. I was so wrong! Hina was my blessing from Mother SD after all. She could not be more perfect and I want to cry of happiness every time I think about her. She is very precious to me.</p>

	<p class="comment">Somehow, she has scooted her little butt into a love triangle? She hangs out with Liam a lot, but I'm afraid her heart will be broken.</p>

	<p class="comment">Her eyes were made by me and were heavily inspired by Slyphynford Tachibana from Himouto Umaruchan, a show I can't stand. Her faceup is blue because I realized I had no brown gouache before painting her.</p>

<h2>dolls that are no longer with me</h2>
<p>I'm not a big fan of selling dolls, but these ones have escaped my grasp (or been thrown from my grasp)</p>

	<p class="comment">I wanted a doll to play with (read: destroy), so I bought an in stock doll from DDE. He came to me with uneven yellowing. Obviously DDE had left this one on display for a while and the front of him was a different color than the back. I will never buy from DDE again.</p>

	<p class="comment">I sanded his chest down to completely flat, gave him a few different faceups, and had a good bit of fun with him. He was visual kei for a while! The sculpt quality wasn't up to my standards and the body was just awful compared to my other dolls. Nothing about him really stood out. Just a plain doll.</p>

	<p class="comment">I gave him a nice girly faceup before sending him off to a new home. I half regret it? The doll wasn't worth much. If I still had him I would have just considered it chump change and would keep him.</p>

	<p class="comment">I did that thing where you put your name in a hat or something at a BBQ expo and they actually pulled my name out! I was off exploring the waterfront with Ryan when I got a text from my friend to hurry back to the convention center and there they presented me with... Mirodoll Mika?!?!! I was hoping for the Ringdoll Amethyst...</p>

	<p class="comment">Excuse me while I look a gift horse in the mouth for an honest review: this doll is trash. She can't stand. All of the joints are jokes. Some aren't even close to round and almost none of them fit together. It's just not a good doll at all. Spend your money on something better if you are looking into Mirodoll.</p>

	<p class="comment">I gifted this doll to tae on the terms that it cannot be sold, only gifted. I unstrung her for the trip to AX and found out she had been put together with exactly ONE s hook (in her head). I'm not sure tae ever got her strung... It'd be a difficult one to string even as a bjd veteran (can I say that yet?)</p>
